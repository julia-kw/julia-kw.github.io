I, Kameryn J Williams, am a mathematician and logician. I am a postdoc in the mathematics department at [University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa](https://math.hawaii.edu/). My PhD is from [The Graduate Center](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Mathematics) of The City University of New York.

My main research interests are in set theory. Much of my work is motivated by the multiversist perspective in set theory, as advanced by [Joel David Hamkins](http://jdh.hamkins.org)—whom I was lucky to have as an advisor at CUNY—and others. Multiversism is the position that there is a plurality of conceptions of set, each giving rise to a different set theoretic universe, rather than a single, ultimate universe of sets. This perspective gives rise to many interesting mathematical questions. Presented very generally: What universes of sets are possible and what properties can they have? What is the structure of the multiverse as a whole? My [dissertation]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/pubs/diss) is specifically focused on the case of second-order set theory, i.e. set theory with proper classes as actual objects, rather than mere syntactic sugar. Most recently, my coauthors and I recently put out a preprint of [a paper on (non)amalgamability in the generic multiverse]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/pubs/set-theoretic-blockchains). 

Besides my interest in pure set theory I am interested in its connections to other areas of logic. Some of my set theoretic work naturally ties into the model theory of models of set theory, and I make good use of admissible set theory, which sits at the intersection of set theory, computability theory, and model theory. I also maintain an interest in models of arithmetic. See the research tab on the navigation bar for more information.

Besides my research work, I am fortunate to have a job where I can share my love of mathematics with my students. There is a depth and beauty to mathematics which I believe everyone can learn and appreciate. Students, see the teaching tab on the navigation bar for information about classes, syllabi, homework, etc.

I also keep a web log where I post snippets of mathematical interest. See the corresponding tab in the navigation bar, where you can also find an online version of my CV and contact information.
