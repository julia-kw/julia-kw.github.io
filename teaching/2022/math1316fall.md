* (10/3) Note that the schedule has been adjusted! I've scheduled time for a retake of quiz three on Thursday 10/6, and the schedule afterward has been adjusted to fit this in.

* [Here]({{ page.url}}q34a-answers.pdf) is the answer key for quizzes 3 and 4.

* [Here]({{ page.url}}q12a-answers.pdf) is the answer key for quizzes 1 and 2.

* [Here]({{ page.url}}sq.pdf) is a sample quiz. The questions are about geometry, not trigonometry, but it should give you an idea of what to expect.

The schedule has seven quiz periods, including the one scheduled during the final exam time. Each quiz period is an opportunity to take mastery quizzes for each mastery topic we've covered so far. You can retake the quiz for a topic each quiz period, and once you've demonstrated mastery in a topic you no longer need to take the corresponding quiz.
