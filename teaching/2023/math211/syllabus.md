**Prerequisite** Mathematics 210.

Learning Outcomes
========

This is the second semester in the calculus sequence. We will cover applications of integration and advanced integration techniques, sequences and series, and introduce parametrically-defined functions, polar coordinates, and differential equations. continuity, derivatives, and an introduction to integrals. When you leave this class you should be able to calculate integrals and apply integration, understand the uses of series in mathematics and how to check for convergence or divergence, be prepared to take linear algebra.

Grading Policy
=======

Your learning outcomes for this class will be assessed with exams and homework. The breakdown for your grade across five components is as follows:

* **30%**: Homework

* **20%**: Midterm 1

* **20%**: Midterm 2

* **20%**: Oral Final Discussion

* **10%**: Metacognition

Grades will be assigned on the standard A through F scale. I reserve the right to make adjustments upward to account for individual circumstance.
	
Homework
========

Homework will be assigned weekly, due in-class the Monday of the following week. The exception for this is review/exam weeks, which have no homework. Instead you should se time outside of class to prepare for the exam. Homework problems will mostly be chosen from the textbook, and posted online to the course website.

Homework will be graded 20% on completion, and 80% based upon a selection of problems from the assignment. For each homework assignment I tell you a small subset of the assigned problems that I will choose from for grading. You must still do all the assignment for the 20% completion points! 

You are encouraged to work together on homework, but the work you turn in is expected to be your own. If you do collaborate with classmates, please say so and give their names with your submitted work.

Homework should be clearly written, so that I can follow the logical steps you take. Each problem should end with the final answer appropriately formulated and circled.

For this class you should expect to spend roughly two hours out of class for each hour of in-class time, for a total of six hours. Homework is due weekly to give you flexibility in when to fit in those six hours. That said, I strongly encourage you to start your homework as soon as possible. Material from later in the week will build on earlier ideas. 

If you will not be able to submit your completed homework on Monday, send me an email to let me know when you will get it to me. You can set an extension time up to the end of the week, and either turn it in at a later class or during office hours. If you are unable to complete it by the extended time, you should reach out to me so we can talk one-to-one about what we can do to ensure your success in this class.

Midterms
========

There will be two midterm exams, each scheduled to be the Friday before a week break. These are in-class, written, individual exams.

**No calculators nor notes are allowed for exams.**

Exam dates:

* Midterm 1: **Friday, 9/29**

* Midterm 2: **Friday, 11/17**

Oral Final Discussion
====

In place of a final exam, I will do oral final discussions. These will be individually scheduled, one-on-one sessions in my office. You will demonstrate how you work through a couple problems, and we will discuss how the class went overall.

For the problems: I will provide a problem list before the sessions. For the demonstration I will ask you to demonstrate one problem of your choice plus one problem of my choice.

Metacognition
=============

Metacognition is the process of thinking about one's own thought process. This is an important part of learning, whether mathematics or other subjects. After each class session you should reflect on your learning. Here are some questions you should ask yourself: What concepts are you confidant in your mastery of? Where do you need to spend more effort? What are your plans for improving your understanding of those concepts? When I return graded homework and midterms to you, does my assessment match how you felt about your work?

A portion of your grade will be based on you demonstrating consistent engagement in metacognitive reflection on your learning. There are two parts to how this is implemented. The two parts are equally weighted, and graded based on completion.

* **Diary** You are expected to keep a diary, either written or electronic, of your reflections on your learning. For Units 1 and 2, you will submit a copy of this to me on the Friday of the end of each unit, by the end of the day. Entries may be short or long, but you should have one per class meeting. In particular, your latest entry should be for that Friday, reflecting on how you feel about the midterm and the unit as a whole. For Unit 3, you will submit this before your oral final discussion.

* **Meeting** In the last week of each unit, you are expected to meet with me during office hours to discuss your progress in the class and make sure we are on the same page. You are encouraged to go to office hours outside of this, but it is only the one meeting that counts toward your grade.

Textbook Information
========

We will use the free online OpenStax text [*Calculus: Volume 2*](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-2) (ISBN: 978-1-947172-14-2). You can also purchase a physical copy (ISBN: 978-1-50669-807-6 or 978-1-938168-06-2), if you prefer. 

Homework will be mostly assigned from the textbook, and the material we cover will correspond to sections from the text. 

Attendance Policy
==========

You are expected to attend class sessions, as per the college attendance policy. No portion of your grade is directly based on attendance, but like most math classes the material in this class builds on itself. If you skip class and fall behind it is difficult to get back on track.

Midterm exams are in-person during the Friday class sessions immediately before the two breaks.

If you miss a class, it is your responsibility to ensure you make up the missed lesson. The schedule on the course website gives the textbook sections we will cover each week, and any worksheets or handouts will be posted on the course website. If you know in advance you will have to miss a class, please email me. 

Class Participation Guidelines
=====

Class time will be spent on a combination of lecture and group work/discussion. A typical class session is structured as follows. For the first 5 minutes I will give you a question to discuss. We'll then have a lecture period for me to explain a new concept, and end with a chance for you to apply the new concepts.

You are expected to participate in all parts of class sessions. For lecture you should be actively listening, taking notes, and asking questions as appropriate. For group work/discussion you should engage in the work, sharing ideas with your classmates.

Mathematics has a reputation for being removed from social concerns and identities. Whether or not this is true for the content of mathematics, it is certainly false  for the process of learning mathematics. Our classroom is to be a welcoming one, where everyone feels able to participate and learn regardless of their background or identity. As learners it is your obligation to treat others with respect and generosity, and be willing to exchange ideas with others.

Communication Policy and Office Hours
=============

Announcements and homework will be posted to the course website. For the gradebook we will use google classroom. 

The best way to contact me outside of class is by email. Please put "math 211" in the subject line of your email.

Office hours are held multiple times in the week, to give you an opportunity to ask questions and receive help in-person outside of class time. If you prefer to meet at a different time, please contact me to arrange that.



Accessibility
=============


Students with disabilities are legally entitled to reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to education. I am committed to providing you with equal access to this class, and am happy to work with you to ensure reasonable accommodations. Because the accommodations offered are usually forward-looking modifications, it is important to get them set up as soon as possible.

Anyone who feels they may need accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact Jeannie Altshuler, Director of Accessibility and Academic
Support, in the Win Commons (`jaltshuler@simons-rock.edu`; 413-528-7383).

The Americans with Disabilities Act defines a disability as a medical condition that substantially limits one or more major life activities—including things like walking, sleeping, taking care of yourself, learning, and regulating your emotions—or major bodily functions. If you have a medical condition—including mental health conditions—that significantly interferes with your schoolwork, you probably qualify. You do not need to disclose your condition to your instructors to receive accommodations. 

Academic Honesty
========

You are expected to know and uphold the college’s policies on
academic honesty as described in the Student Handbook. For many majors, mathematics classes form part of the core base of skills you need to succeed in later classes, and you are harming the future version of yourself if you try to avoid learning the material for this class.

You are encouraged to collaborate for homework, but the work you submit is expected to be your own. If you do work with others, please say so and give their names with your submitted homework.


Other Campus Resources
=====

The [Wellness Center Health and Counseling Services](https://simons-rock.edu/student-life/living-on-campus/wellness-center.php), as the name says, offers health and counseling services. 

The [Win Student Resources Commons](https://simons-rock.edu/early-college/contact-us/offices-and-departments/win-commons.php) offers academic support, tutoring, accessibility, and career advice.
