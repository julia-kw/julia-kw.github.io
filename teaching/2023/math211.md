Announcements
-------------

* (10/23) Remember there is no class Wednesday 10/25.

* (10/18) If you want to know more about what Galois did to show the unsolvability of the quintic and aren't happy with a brief "this would be an entire algebra class", the [wikipedia page for Galois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois#Galois_theory) has a short statement of what he showed. And clicking some of the links will give you an idea of how much theory needs to be built up to get at Galois's proof.

* (10/5) [Here](e1answers.pdf) is the answer key for midterm 1.

* (9/27) To turn in your unit 1 metacognition diary on Friday, 9/29: after the exam you should have one final entry, reflecting on the unit as a whole. After you finish that, either email me your diary or drop off a physical copy at my office. (If I'm not there, leave it in the mailbox.)

* (9/25) For the midterm week I am holding extra office hours. In addition to the times on the syllabus, I'll be in my office M 2:30–3:30, T 9:00–11:00, W 8:30–9:00 and 3:30–4:00.

* (9/22) For the midterm, you will get a formula sheet with the formulas for arc length and surface area. For the other formulas you need: if you can remember the picture for breaking the problem up into infinitely small pieces, that picture gives you the formula.

* (9/19) **Remember that the first midterm is Friday, September 29th.**

* (9/19) [Here]({{ page.url }}sg1.pdf) is a study guide for the first midterm.

* (9/11) The tutor for calc 2, Cathy Zhang, will be holding review sessions on Fridays 6–7pm. 

Homework
--------

For each assignment I will pick 2 to 4 of the bolded problems to grade and give you feedback on. That will comprise 80% of your grade for the assignment, with the remaining 20% being based on completion.

* *Week 9 (due Monday 11/6):*

   5.3 (p482) 144, 153, **161**

   5.4 (p493) **198**, 211, **218**, 246

   5.2 (p466) 68, 70, **80**, 87, 88, **90**

   *** Write the number $0.142857142857\ldots$ as a geometric series, and use this to write it as a fraction.

   *** Determine whether the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt n}$ converges or diverges by comparing it to an appropriate improper integral.

* *Week 7 (due Monday 10/23):*

    3.7 (p343) 348, 353, 355, **358**, 401, **404**.

    3.4 (p308) **184**, 190, **198**, 199.

    *** Without actually computing it, explain the steps you would take to evaluate the integral $\int_{-1}^1 \frac{x^5 + 5x}{(x^2 - 4)^2(x^2 + 4)} \,\mathrm{d}x$. As part of your answer, determine the denominators that appear in the partial fraction decomposition (but don't compute their numerators!). And explain for each term in the partial fraction decomposition what method you would use to integrate that part.

* *Week 6 (due Monday 10/16):*

    3.1 (p270) 6, 7, **16**, 41

    *** Can you use integration by parts to evaluate $\int x^{1000}e^x \,\mathrm{d}x$? If so, explain what the process would be and why you know your process would eventually give an answer. If not, explain why the process won't ever give an answer. (Please don't actually try to compute this integral!)

   *** Same question but for $\int e^x \ln x \,\mathrm{d}x$. (Again, please don't try to actually compute it!)

   3.2 (p283) 73, **74**, **96**, 121, **124**, 125

* *Week 5:* No homework due to midterm Friday.

* *Week 4 (due Monday 9/25):*

    2.6 (p217) 261, 262, **268**

    *** The uniform probability distribution on an interval $[a,b]$ is the one given by the distribution function $\rho(x) = \frac{1}{b-a}$, with the domain $a \le x \le b$. Check that this really is a probability distribution function and determine its mean. Write a sentence or two giving an intuitive explanation for why its mean should be what you calculated.

    2.7 (p230) 296, 298, 299, **322**, **332**, 333

    2.8 (p141) 348, **357**, 367, 374--376

    1.7 (p111) 392;

    2.1 (p131) 5, **6**, **9**, **35**. [Note: chapter 1 is a review of material you should have covered in calc 1.]
