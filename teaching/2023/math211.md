Announcements
-------------

* (11/29) [Here]({{ page.url }}e2answers.pdf) is the answer key for midterm 2.

* (11/28) [Here]({{ page.url }}final.pdf) are the questions for the oral final. You will schedule a time to meet with me to present your solutions to two of the problems. Full instructions, including the grading rubric for the final, are in the pdf. The link to the sign-up sheet will be sent via email.

* (11/10) I'm holding extra office hours the week of the midterm, so you have plenty of opportunity for last minute questions before the exam and for your metacognition meetings:

    Monday 8:30–9:30, 2:30–3:30
    
    Tuesday 2:00–4:00
    
    Wednesday 8:30–10:00, 2:30–4:00
    
    Friday 9:00–10:00



* (11/7) **Remember that the second midterm is Friday, November 17th.** You will also need to turn in your unit 2 metacognition on the 17th after the exam, and you will need to do a check-in with me during office hours that week.

* (11/7) [Here]({{ page.url }}sg2.pdf) is a study guide for the second midterm. You are allowed a one-page note sheet for the exam; see the study guide for full information. 

* (10/23) Remember there is no class Wednesday 10/25.

* (10/18) If you want to know more about what Galois did to show the unsolvability of the quintic and aren't happy with a brief "this would be an entire algebra class", the [wikipedia page for Galois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois#Galois_theory) has a short statement of what he showed. And clicking some of the links will give you an idea of how much theory needs to be built up to get at Galois's proof.

* (10/5) [Here](e1answers.pdf) is the answer key for midterm 1.

* (9/27) To turn in your unit 1 metacognition diary on Friday, 9/29: after the exam you should have one final entry, reflecting on the unit as a whole. After you finish that, either email me your diary or drop off a physical copy at my office. (If I'm not there, leave it in the mailbox.)

* (9/25) For the midterm week I am holding extra office hours. In addition to the times on the syllabus, I'll be in my office M 2:30–3:30, T 9:00–11:00, W 8:30–9:00 and 3:30–4:00.

* (9/22) For the midterm, you will get a formula sheet with the formulas for arc length and surface area. For the other formulas you need: if you can remember the picture for breaking the problem up into infinitely small pieces, that picture gives you the formula.

* (9/19) **Remember that the first midterm is Friday, September 29th.**

* (9/19) [Here]({{ page.url }}sg1.pdf) is a study guide for the first midterm.

* (9/11) The tutor for calc 2, Cathy Zhang, will be holding review sessions on Fridays 6–7pm. 

Homework
--------

For each assignment I will pick 2 to 4 of the bolded problems to grade and give you feedback on. That will comprise 80% of your grade for the assignment, with the remaining 20% being based on completion.

  7.2 (p640) 64, **66**, 70, 108, **115**

  4.3 (p391) 123, **128**, 133

  *** Do problem (6) from the 11-29 worksheet, reproduced here: You have an outdoor saltwater pool, as is normal in the Berkshires. The pool has a volume of  15,000 gallons. You want it to have the salinity of seawater, 35 parts per thousand of salt per water, which comes out to .3 lb of salt for each gallon of water. You miscalculated the size of your pool and put in 5500 lb of salt, which is too much. To fix this, you drain the pool at the rate of 5 gallons per minute while simultaneously filling it with fresh water at the rate of 5 gallons per minute. Meanwhile, you constantly stir the water to keep it the salt distribution uniform. Write a differential equation which describes the change in the quantity s of salt in the pool (in pounds) at time t (in minutes). Solve this differential equation to determine how long you need to drain the pool and refill it with fresh water to reach the optimal salt level of 4500 lb.
