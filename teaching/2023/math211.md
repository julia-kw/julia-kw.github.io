Homework
--------

For each assignment I will pick 2 to 4 of the bolded problems to grade and give you feedback on. That will comprise 80% of your grade for the assignment, with the remaining 20% being based on completion.

* *Week 1 (due Monday 9/4):*

    1.4 (p73) 209, 210;

    1.5 (p90) **255**, 276;

    1.6 (p103) 320, **328**;

    1.7 (p111) 392;

    2.1 (p131) 5, **6**, **9**, **35**. [Note: chapter 1 is a review of material you should have covered in calc 1.]
