Announcements
-------------

* (10/5) You have a chance to make up lost points on the last two questions of the midterm. **For each problem, if you want to earn points you lost on the midterm: do both parts of the problem and submit it to me by Friday, 10/13.** If you give full correct solutions to both parts then I will update your exam grade to give you full points for the problem. Remember, the point of these problems is for you to understand the process from which the rules for derivatives come from. I will not give you points if you don't show all steps of the process. See [here](problems10-11.pdf) for a clean pdf with just those two problems.

* (10/5) [Here](e1-partialanswers.pdf) is the answer key for midterm 1, excluding the last two problems.

* (9/27) To turn in your unit 1 metacognition diary on Friday, 9/29: after the exam you should have one final entry, reflecting on the unit as a whole. After you finish that, either email me your diary or drop off a physical copy at my office. (If I'm not there, leave it in the mailbox.)

* (9/25) For the midterm week I am holding extra office hours. In addition to the times on the syllabus, I'll be in my office M 2:30–3:30, T 9:00–11:00, W 8:30–9:00 and 3:30–4:00.

* (9/19) **Remember that the first midterm is Friday, September 29th.**

* (9/19) [Here]({{ page.url }}sg1.pdf) is a study guide for the first midterm.

* (9/18) [Here]({{ page.url }}diff-rules.pdf) is a sheet of the rules for derivatives. (Note: These rules are spread across sections 3.3, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, and 3.9 of the textbook.)

* (9/11) The tutor for calc 1, Theo Lack, will be hodling review sessions on Sunday 6–7.

* (8/28) [Here]({{ page.url }}day1.pdf) are the introduction slides from day 1.

Homework
--------

For each assignment I will pick among the bolded or starred problems to grade and give you feedback on. That will comprise 80% of your grade for the assignment, with the remaining 20% being based on completion.

* *Week 6 (due Monday 10/16)*:

   *** Do (A) of [the 10/9 worksheet](w10-9.pdf).

   *** Do (B) of [the 10/9 worksheet](w10-9.pdf).

   3.8 (p317) 302, 307, **312**, **328**

   3.9 (p331) 346, **348**, 351, 357

* *Week 5:* No homework due to midterm Friday.

* *Week 4 (due Monday 9/25)*:

   *** Use the limit definition of the derivative to show that the derivative of $\sqrt x$ is $\frac{1}{2\sqrt x}$.

   *** Use the quotient rule and the rules for the derivatives of $\sin x$ and $\cos x$ to determine the derivatives of $\sec x$ and $\cot x$.

   *** Use the chain rule and the product rule to derive the quotient rule.

    2.3 (p176) 87, 91, **93**, 99, **102**, 106, 108

    *** Use the limit rules in Theorem 2.5 (p161) to compute the limit $\lim\_{x \to 3} (2x - 1)^2$. Give a step by step argument, identifying the rule used at each step.

    *** Use the squeeze theorem to compute the limit $\lim\_{x \to 0} x^2 \cos(1/x)$. Give your answer as a paragraph along with your calculations, explaining why your calculations demonstrate what the limit is.
