* See [here]({{ page.url }}syllabus) for the syllabus.


Announcements
-------------

* [Here]({{ page.url }}day1.pdf) are the introduction slides from day 1.

Homework
--------

For each assignment I will pick among the bolded or starred problems to grade and give you feedback on. That will comprise 80% of your grade for the assignment, with the remaining 20% being based on completion.

* *Week 2 (due Monday 9/11):*

    2.3 (p176) 87, 91, **93**, 99, **102**, 106, 108

    *** Use the limit rules in Theorem 2.5 (p161) to compute the limit $\lim\_{x \to 3} (2x - 1)^2$. Give a step by step argument, identifying the rule used at each step.

    *** Use the squeeze theorem to compute the limit $\lim\_{x \to 0} x^2 \cos(1/x)$. Give your answer as a paragraph along with your calculations, explaining why your calculations demonstrate what the limit is.

    4.6 (p436) 261, **266**, 279, 287

    2.4 (p191) 133, **141**, 145, 158, 161

* *Week 1 (due Monday 9/4):*

    1.1 (p32) 37, 44;

    1.2 (p59) **87**, 98;

    1.3 (p75) **155**, 170;

    1.4 (p92) 191, **216**;

    1.5 (p114) 243, **288**;

    2.2 (p155) **42**, 50–54, 76, **77**. [Note: chapter 1 is a review of material you should have covered in a previous class.]

Schedule
--------

This course is organized into three units. Units 1 and 2 each end in a midterm, while unit 3 ends in an oral final discussion. Homework is assigned weekly (except on exam weeks), and is due Monday the following week.

The schedule below is tentative; we might have small adjustments in the dates. For each week I've included which sections from the textbook we will be covering.

* Unit 1 (8/28–9/29): **Limits, continuity, and introduction to the derivative**

    * Week 1: Introduction, the concept of the limit [Ch 1, 2.2]
	
    * Week 2: Limit laws, continuity [2.3, 4.6, 2.4]
	
    * Week 3: Precise defintions of limits and derivatives [2.5, 3.1, 3.2]
	
    * Week 4: Rules for differentiating [3.3, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.9]
	
    * Week 5: Overspill, review, exam
	
* Unit 2 (10/9–11/17): **Applications of differentation and introduction to integration**

    * Week 6: Rates of change, implicit differentiation, logarithmic differentation [3.4, 3.8, 3.9]
	
    * Week 7: Related rates, the mean value theorem, and L'Hôpital's rule [4.1, 4.4, 4.8]

    * Week 10: Definite integrals and the fundamental theorem of calculus [5.2, 5.3]
	
    * Week 11: Overspill, review, exam

* Unit 3 (11/27–12/13): **Rules for integration**

    * Week 12: Rules for integration, substitution [5.4, 5.5]
	
    * Week 13: Integration and logarithms, integrals involving inverse trig functions [5.6,  5.7]
	
    * Week 14: Overspill, review
