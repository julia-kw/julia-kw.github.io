    Writing: Write the statement of the fundamental theorem of calculus (both parts!) and give an informal explanation for why it is true. (Extra Credit) The Transfer Principle says that any equality or inequality about real functions true in the reals is also true in the hyperreals. We could formulate the same principle but going from the rational numbers to the real numbers: "Any equality or inequality about rational functions true in the rationals is also true in the reals." Is this rational to real transfer principle true or false? Justify your answer

Schedule
--------

This course is organized into three units. Units 1 and 2 each end in a midterm, while unit 3 ends in the oral final. Homework is assigned weekly.

The schedule below is tentative; we might have small adjustments in the dates. For each week I've included which sections from the textbook we will be covering.

* Unit 1 (1/27–2/28): **Applications of integration**

    * Week 1: Intro, review
	
    * Week 2: Volume [6.1, 6.2]
	
    * Week 3: Arc length, surface area, averages [6.3, 6.4, 6.5]
	
    * Week 4: Applications to physics, improper integrals [6.6, 6.7]
	
    * Week 5: Overspill, review, exam
	
* Unit 2 (3/3–4/16): **Advanced integration, series**

    * Week 6: Integration by parts, trig integrals [7.4, 7.5]
	
    * Week 7: Trig substitution, rational functions [7.6, 8.8]

    * *Spring break!*
	
    * Week 8: Intro to sequences and series [9.1, 9.2, 9.3]
	
    * Week 9: Tests for convergence and divergence [9.4, 9.5, 9.6]
	
    * Week 10: Power series [9.7, 9.8, 9.10, 9.11]
	
    * Week 11: Review, exam

* Unit 3 (4/21–5/7): **Calculus in other coordinates**

    * Week 12: Polar calculus [7.7, 7.8, 7.9]
	
    * Week 13: Parametric calculus [10.1, 10.6, 10.7]
	
    * Week 14: Oral finals.
	
Important dates:

* **Friday, Feb 28**: Midterm 1
