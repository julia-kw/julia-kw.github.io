**Class Meets** Mondays/Wednesdays/Fridays 10:30–11:20


* See [here]({{ page.url }}syllabus) for the syllabus.

* Class meetings will be conducted over Zoom. Access info can be found on the Laulima site or the Discord for the class.

* Outside of Zoom there are two main ways I will communicate with you: (1) This site, the public site for the class, where I will post homework, announcements, and any lecture notes; (2) a Discord channel, where I will also post announcements, where you can ask questions and discuss things with your classmates. Assignment submission will be done through Gradescope.


Course Outline
------

The main goal of this class is to teach you the basic methods and language of mathematics. In particular, the keystone of the class is the notion of proof, the means by which we justify mathematical statements as true. This class forms the foundation for upper division math classes, and what you learn here will serve you in further mathematical investigations. 

Announcements
-------------

* (3/5) The midterm is a take-home exam. It will be handed out next Monday (3/8) and be due the following Sunday (3/14). There will be no homework during midterm week.

* (1/20) Here are some resources on guidelines for writing mathematics:

    * [From Francis Su at Harvey Mudd College.](https://math.hmc.edu/su/writing-math-well/)

    * [From Kevin Lee at UC Davis.](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~amenta/w10/writingman.pdf)

    * [From Kevin Houston at University of Leeds.](https://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~khouston/pdf/htwm.pdf)

    * [A blog post by Terence Tao at UCLA.](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/advice-on-writing-papers/)

    * [A book by Donald Knuth, Tracy Larrabee, and Paul Roberts.](https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/reviewing-papers/knuth_mathematical_writing.pdf)

* (1/20) In lecture, we discuss the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, stating that every positive integer has a unique prime factorization. You may think that this is an obvious fact which could not possibly be in need of a proof. If you think that, I suggest reading [this blog post](https://gowers.wordpress.com/2011/11/13/why-isnt-the-fundamental-theorem-of-arithmetic-obvious/) by Tim Gowers. If you don't think it's obvious, I'd suggest reading the post anyway. It is a nice little peak into how what we are talking about with the integers can be generalized, and why that generalization can be difficult.

* **No class Monday, January 18th an account of MLK Day**

* (1/13) For homework, you are strongly encouraged to use LaTeX. LaTeX is a program for typesetting mathematics, and is the standard in academic math, physics, and compsci. The learning curve can be a bit tough to start, but once you pick up the basics it can be much faster than mucking about with an equation editor. If you haven't used LaTeX before, I suggest using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), a free online LaTeX editor. To help get you started, I made a [template for homework](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ypsrcqntbcrs). 

    The way LaTeX works is, you have a plaintext file which is complied into a pdf. (Overleaf does this part automatically for you.) The commands you put in the plaintext file then determine what shows up in the pdf. For example, to display the inequality $\sqrt[3]{x} \le \frac{x+1}{x^2+1}$ you would write `\sqrt[3]{x} \le \frac{x+1}{x^2+1}$`. The dollar signs say that what goes inside should be typeset as math, not as ordinary English. The various symbols =, +, 1, etc. are interpreted normally, while `\frac` is the fraction command. The next two inputs, as inclosed in braces, are typset to be the numerator and denominator of the fraction. Similarly, `\sqrt` is the square root command. It has an optional input, inclosed in square brackets. In this case, the optional input was used to make it a cube root.
