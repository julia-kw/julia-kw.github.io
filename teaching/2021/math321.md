**Class Meets** Mondays/Wednesdays/Fridays 10:30â€“11:20


* See [here]({{ page.url }}syllabus) for the syllabus.

* Class meetings will be conducted over Zoom. Access info can be found on the Laulima site or the Discord for the class.

* Outside of Zoom there are two main ways I will communicate with you: (1) This site, the public site for the class, where I will post homework, announcements, and any lecture notes; (2) a Discord channel, where I will also post announcements, where you can ask questions and discuss things with your classmates. Assignment submission will be done through Gradescope.


Course Outline
------

The main goal of this class is to teach you the basic methods and language of mathematics. In particular, the keystone of the class is the notion of proof, the means by which we justify mathematical statements as true. This class forms the foundation for upper division math classes, and what you learn here will serve you in further mathematical investigations.
