Grading Policy
=======

The break-down for your grade is as follows:

* 72% Exams

* 16% Homework

* 12% In-class work

To calculate your final grade, I will drop your lowest in-class work assignment and your lowest two homework assignments.

Grades will be assigned based upon the standard F to A scale, with one caveat. I do not anticipate this happening, but I reserve the right to later move the intervals downward if I decide a curve is necessary.

* [90,100] A; 

* [80,90) B; 

* [70,80) C; 

* [60,70) D; 

* [0,60) F. 

Class Structure
=====

Class will be held face-to-face. This course is structured into 7 bi-weekly modules, each about a different topic. Each module will conclude with an exam, which will be held on a Wednesday.

This is a coordinated class; all sections of Math 1332 are covering the same material with the same schedule. In particular, if you have to self-isolate due to a positive covid test, please reach out to me so we can arrange for you to attend lecture via one of the zoom sections of this class.

Attendance Policy
==========

A portion of your grade is based on in-class activities, one per module. Besides that and exam dates, attendance is not mandatory. However, you are strongly encouraged to attend all class meetings. If you must be absent during one of these dates, please contact me so we can arrange for how you can complete the class material. You also should get in touch if you will have to be absent for multiple classes in a row, for example if you have to quarantine due to a positive covid test.

Homework Policy
========

Weekly homework will be assigned through the online Edfinity system. The fee for this site is included in your Bearkat Bundle. If you opt out of the Bearkat Bundle program, then you will have to pay the fee directly.

Access details for the online homework will be announced shortly.

Exam Policy
====

Each module will conclude with an exam. All exams are equally weighted, and I will drop the lowest exam score when calculating your overall grade. (So your overall grade will include grades from 6 exams, each worth 12% of your overall grade.)

**There will be no final exam.**

Tentative exam dates:

* Exam 1: Wednesday, September 1

* Exam 2: Wednesday, September 15

* Exam 3: Wednesday, September 29

* Exam 4: Wednesday, October 13

* Exam 5: Wednesday, October 27

* Exam 6: Wednesday, November 10

* Exam 7: Wednesday, December 1

Communication Policy and Office Hours
=============

Announcements, homework assignments, and similar will be posted to the public course website. Private information, such as grades, can be found via the blackboard site.

There is a discord server for this course, which is a place to contact me, ask questions, and discuss course material with your classmates. You can also email me, but that is less likely to be seen as quickly. If you do email me, please mention the class number (Math 1332) in the subject of the message.

Office hours are held three times a week, to give you an opportunity to ask questions and receive help in-person outside of class time. If you prefer to meet virtually via zoom, or to meet at a different time, please contact me to arrange that.

Covid Policy
=====

Per the governor's orders, the university is not allowed to require you to vaccinate nor institute a mask mandate. That aside, I encourage you to get vaccinated, if you have not yet already done so. You can get vaccinated through the [Student Health Center](https://www.shsu.edu/dept/student-health-center/), who also offer covid testing. **Both vaccines and testing through the SHC are free of cost.**

The CDC recommends indoor masking in areas with high transmission rates. This includes (at the beginning of the semester—perhaps this will change in the future) Walker County. I will be wearing a mask for class and office hours. I encourage you to do the same, especially if you are not yet vaccinated.

If you have a positive covid test, or have strong reason to think you may have covid pending a test, you should self-isolate. Contact me so I know you will miss class and we can work out how you can continue to follow class progress during your quarantine.

Academic Honesty
========

Cheating, plagiarism, and other forms of academic dishonesty are not tolerated.

Accessibility
=============

Students with disabilities are legally entitled to reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to education. Any student who feels they may need accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the Students with Disabilities office. I am committed to providing students with equal access to this class, and am happy to work with you to ensure reasonable accommodations. Because the accommodations offered are usually forward-looking modifications rather than mitigating poor grades you may have already received due to your disability, it is important to get in touch with the office as soon as you can. Further information and contact details can be found on [their website](https://www.shsu.edu/dept/disability).

The ADA defines a disability as a medical condition that substantially limits one or more major life activities—including things like walking sleeping, taking care of yourself, learning, and regulating your emotions—or major bodily functions. If you have a medical condition—including mental health conditions—that significantly interferes with your schoolwork, you probably qualify. You do not need to disclose your condition to your instructors to receive accommodations. 


Other Campus Resources
=====

* The [Student Health Center](https://www.shsu.edu/dept/student-health-center) offers healthcare resources to students, including covid vaccines and testing.

* The [Counseling Center](https://www.shsu.edu/dept/counseling) offers counseling services to students.

* The [Academic Success Center](https://www.shsu.edu/centers/academic-success-center) offers tutoring and other academic support to students.

* The [on-campus food pantry](https://www.shsu.edu/academics/health-sciences/food-pantry) supports students who face food insecurity.
