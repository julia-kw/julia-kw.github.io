Class Information
=====

**Course Title** Elementary Functions

**Instructor** Kameryn Williams

**Website** [http://kamerynjw.net/teaching/2021/math1410/]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/2021/math1410/)

**Email** `kjw059 [ at ] shsu ( period ) edu`

**Class Hours** MWF 3:30–4:45

**Room** LDB 209

**Office Hours** M 2:00–3:00, WF 9:00–9:55

**Office** LDB 413

**Textbook** None required, but [the free online OpenStax text *Precalculus*](https://openstax.org/details/books/precalculus) is a helpful reference

**Course Description** Elementary Functions and their applications, including topics from algebra, trigonometry, and analytic geometry, are used to assist in the algebraic and graphical description of the following elementary functions: polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions. This course is for students intending to take calculus (Math 1420).

**Prerequisite** Passing score on MATH TSI Assesment or equivalent.

**Course Objectives** Math 1410 is designed to meet the objectives of Component Area 2 of the core curriculum and to prepare students for calculus courses. Students completing this course should expect to improve upontheir:

* *Critical Thinking Skills.* Students will analyze and synthesizemathematical concepts and ideas. Students will be able to solve mathematical problems related to the topics of polynomial, rational, exponential, and trigonometric functions.

* *Mathematical Communication.* Students will be able to explainproblem solving processes and logical reasoning in writing.

* *Quantitative Skills.* Students will be able to set up and perform calculations related to polynomial, rational, exponential, and trigonemetric functions.

Grading Policy
=======

The break-down for your grade is as follows:

* 20% Midterm 1

* 20% Midterm 2

* 20% Final Exam

* 20% Homework

* 20% In-class work

To calculate your final grade, I will drop your lowest two assignments each for homework and in-class work.

Grades will be assigned based upon the standard F to A scale, with one caveat. **To receive a passing grade (C or above) in this class, either your average across all three exams must be at least 70%, or your final exam grade must be at least 70%.** I do not anticipate this happening, but I reserve the right to later move the intervals downward if I decide a curve is necessary.

* [90,100] A; 

* [80,90) B; 

* [70,80) C; 

* [60,70) D; 

* [0,60) F. 

Class Structure
=====

Class will be held face-to-face, with the following weekly structure. Mondays and Wednesdays will be used for lecture while Friday will be used for in-class group work. Homework will be assigned weekly, due Mondays at the beginning of class. 

Attendance Policy
==========

A portion of your grade is based on Friday in-class activities. Besides that, attendance is not mandatory. However, you are strongly encouraged to attend all class meetings. If you will be absent for a Friday meeting, please get in touch with me in advance so we can arrange for you to submit the in-class work via alternative means. You also should get in touch if you will have to be absent for multiple classes in a row, for example if you have to quarantine due to a positive covid test.

Homework Policy
========

Homework will be assigned weekly (except for exam weeks) through the free, open source, online system MyOpenMath. Each week's homework will be due end of day Monday of the following week. (With the exception of the homework for the week of 8/30, which will be due Tuesday because Monday, 9/6 is a holiday.) Access details for the MyOpenMath site will be announced shortly.


Exam Policy
====

There will be two midterms and one final exam. Each midterm will consist of an in-class portion, worth 75% of the overall grade, and a take-home portion, worth 25% of the grade and due the following Monday.

Tentative midterm dates:

* Midterm 1: Friday, September 24

* Midterm 2: Friday, November 5

* Final exam: TBA


Communication Policy and Office Hours
=============

Announcements, homework assignments, and similar will be posted to the public course website. Private information, such as grades, can be found via the blackboard site.

There is a discord server for this course, which is a place to contact me, ask questions, and discuss course material with your classmates. You can also email me, but that is less likely to be seen as quickly. If you do email me, please mention the class number (Math 1410) in the subject of the message.

Office hours are held three times a week, to give you an opportunity to ask questions and receive help in-person outside of class time. If you prefer to meet virtually via zoom, or to meet at a different time, please contact me to arrange that.

Covid Policy
=====

Per the governor's orders, the university is not allowed to require you to vaccinate nor institute a mask mandate. That aside, I encourage you to get vaccinated, if you have not yet already done so. You can get vaccinated through the [Student Health Center](https://www.shsu.edu/dept/student-health-centetr/), who also offer covid testing. **Both vaccines and testing through the SHC are free of cost.**

The CDC recommends indoor masking in areas with high transmission rates. This includes (at the beginning of the semester—perhaps this will change in the future) Walker County. I will be wearing a mask for class and office hours. I encourage you to do the same, especially if you are not yet vaccinated.

If you have a positive covid test, or have strong reason to think you may have covid pending a test, you should self-isolate. Contact me so I know you will miss class and we can work out how you can continue to follow class progress during your quarantine.

Academic Honesty
========

Cheating, plagiarism, and other forms of academic dishonesty are not tolerated.
This holds for every class, but I want to especially emphasize it here. This class is the gateway to calculus, which is prerequisite to many classes in mathematics, science, and engineering. What you learn here forms the basis of what you will do in those classes. If you cheat here it will only come back to hurt you in future classes. 

Accessibility
=============

Students with disabilities are legally entitled to reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to education. Any student who feels they may need accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the Students with Disabilities office. I am committed to providing students with equal access to this class, and am happy to work with you to ensure reasonable accommodations. Because the accommodations offered are usually forward-looking modifications rather than mitigating poor grades you may have already received due to your disability, it is important to get in touch with the office as soon as you can. Further information and contact details can be found on [their website](https://www.shsu.edu/dept/disability).

The ADA defines a disability as a medical condition that substantially limits one or more major life activities—including things like walking sleeping, taking care of yourself, learning, and regulating your emotions—or major bodily functions. If you have a medical condition—including mental health conditions—that significantly interferes with your schoolwork, you probably qualify. You do not need to disclose your condition to your instructors to receive accommodations. 


Other Campus Resources
=====

* The [Student Health Center](https://www.shsu.edu/dept/student-health-center) offers healthcare resources to students, including covid vaccines and testing.

* The [Counseling Center](https://www.shsu.edu/dept/counseling) offers counseling services to students.

* The [Academic Success Center](https://www.shsu.edu/centers/academic-success-center) offers tutoring and other academic support to students.

* The [on-campus food pantry](https://www.shsu.edu/academics/health-sciences/food-pantry) supports students who face food insecurity.
