Grading Policy
=======

The break-down for your grade is as follows:

* 20% Midterm 1

* 20% Midterm 2

* 20% Final project

* 20% Online homework

* 20% In-class work

Grades will be assigned based upon the standard F to A scale. I do not anticipate this happening, but I reserve the right to later move the intervals downward if I decide a curve is necessary.

* [93,100] A; 

* [90,93) A-; 

* [87,90) B+; 

* [83,87) B;

Final Projects
=====

As part of this class I will ask you to do a project about applications of differential equations. You will write about an application of differential equations to a topic of your choice. Details TBA


Virtual Office Hours
=======

Office hours will be held virtually, details to be announced.


Academic Honesty
========

Cheating, plagiarism, and other forms of academic dishonesty are not tolerated.
This holds for every class, but I want to especially emphasize it here. This class is the gateway to most upper division mathematics classes, and what you learn here forms the basis of what you will do in those classes. If you cheat here it will only come back to hurt you in future classes. 

KOKUA Program and Accessibility
=====

Students with disabilities are legally entitled to reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to education. Any student who feels they may need accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the KOKUA Program, the UH Mānoa office for students with disabilities. I am committed to providing students with equal access to this class, and am happy to work with you and KOKUA to ensure reasonable accommodations in my course. Because the accommodations offered are usually forward-looking modifications rather than mitigating poor grades you may have already received due to your disability, it is important to get in touch with the KOKUA Program as soon as you can. Further information and contact details can be found on [their website](http://www.hawaii.edu/kokua/). 

Accessibility is especially saliant when the class is ran virtually and everything is mediated through the use of technology, much of which is not adequately designed with accessibility in mind. I ask that you contact me as soon as possible if there is an accommodation you need for any of the online materials for the class, so that we can get it taken care of as soon as possible.

The ADA defines a disability as a medical condition that substantially limits one or more major life activities—including things like walking sleeping, taking care of yourself, learning, and regulating your emotions—or major bodily functions. If you have a medical condition—including mental health conditions—that significantly interferes with your schoolwork, you probably qualify. You do not need to disclose your condition to your instructors to receive accommodations. 



Counseling and Student Development Center
==========

The [Counseling and Student Development Center](http://www.manoa.hawaii.edu/counseling/) offers confidential counseling services to support students with personal, academic, or career concerns. 


Food Vault Hawaiʻi
====

Groups on campus have organized a food pantry, free to use for students at UH Mānoa. All registered students with a valid student ID may access the food pantry. Further information, including location and schedule, can be found [here](https://www.hawaii.edu/news/2018/11/30/manoa-food-pantry/) or on [this facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/foodvaulthawaii/).
