**Class Meets** Mondays/Wednesdays/Fridays 9:30â€“10:20

* See [here]({{ page.url }}syllabus) for the syllabus.

* Class meetings will be conducted over Zoom. Access info can be found on the Laulima site or the Discord for the class.

* Outside of Zoom there are two main ways I will communicate with you: (1) This site, the public site for the class, where I will post announcements and any lecture notes; (2) a Discord channel, where I will also post announcements, where you can ask questions and discuss things with your classmates. Assignment submission will be done through Gradescope, and online homework will be done through UHM's WeBWorK site.

* 1/15: Direction fields.

    Go to [this webpage](https://www.geogebra.org/m/W7dAdgqc) (or a different online direction field plotter). 

    1. Use the direction field plotter to graph direction fields for differential equations of the form $y' = Ky$ for different constants $K$. When does the differential equation have an asymptotically stable equilibrium solution as $x \to \infty$, and what value is approached? Building on this, find a differential equation with an asymptotically stable equilibrium solution as $x \to \infty$ which approaches the value $3$. And do the same for approaching an arbitrary value $v$.

    2. Use the direction field plotter to graph direction fields for differential equations of the form $y' = Ky(M - y)$, where $K$ and $M$ are positive constants. These are logistic differential equations, which are used to model population growth given a maximum carrying capacity $M$. If you have the initial value $y(0)$ is positive, what value is approached as $x \to \infty$? Compare this behavior to what happens with the differential equations $y' = Ky$, and discuss the relative merits/dismerits of the two kinds of differential equations for modeling population growth.

    3. Use the direction field plotter to graph direction fields for differential equations of the form $y' = f(x)$, for the following choices for $f(x)$: $f(x) = e^x$, $f(x) = \cos(x)$, and $f(x) = 1/x$. Use your knowledge of calculus to determine the general solutions for these three differential equations.
