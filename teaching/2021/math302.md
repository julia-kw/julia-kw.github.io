**Class Meets** Mondays/Wednesdays/Fridays 9:30â€“10:20

* See [here]({{ page.url }}syllabus) for the syllabus.

* Class meetings will be conducted over Zoom. Access info can be found on the Laulima site or the Discord for the class.

* Outside of Zoom there are two main ways I will communicate with you: (1) This site, the public site for the class, where I will post announcements and any lecture notes; (2) a Discord channel, where I will also post announcements, where you can ask questions and discuss things with your classmates. Assignment submission will be done through Gradescope, and online homework will be done through UHM's WeBWorK site.


Announcements
-------------

* The first midterm will be a take-home exam. I will release it on gradescope on Wednesday, February 17th after class, and it will be due by the end of Sunday, February 21st.

* **No class Monday, February 15th on account of Presidents Day**

* **No class Monday, January 18th on account of MLK Day**
