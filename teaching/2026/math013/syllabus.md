**Course Description** This course is designed to pair with a college-level Quantitative Reasoning class. It provides a review of
the prerequisite mathematical skills needed in Quantitative Reasoning. Students receive targeted support with
arithmetic and algebra topics using a “just-in-time” approach. This course also reinforces topics covered in the paired
Quantitative Reasoning course

**Prerequisite** MAT011 or satisfactory basic skills assessment score

**Departmental Syllabus** (with formal learning outcomes) [https://www.capecod.edu/media/capecodedu/content-assets/documents/syllabi/MAT013-Support-Topics-for-Quantitative-Reasoning-2024.pdf](https://www.capecod.edu/media/capecodedu/content-assets/documents/syllabi/MAT013-Support-Topics-for-Quantitative-Reasoning-2024.pdf)

Informal Learning Outcomes
========

This course is a companion to Math 130 designed as a support to provide you with extra practice for the foundations of that course.


Grading Policy
=======

This course is graded on a Pass/Retake/Fail system. Here are the specifications you are required to meet for each outcome.

* **Pass.** Complete all but five in-class activities, or else acheive a C or better in the companion Math 130 class.

* **Retake.** Not meet the requirements for a Pass, but remain active in this class  through the semester.

* **Fail.** Not meet the requriements for a Retake, namely stop participating in this class and the companion Math 130 class. 
	
In-Class Exercises
========

This class will be used for extra practice to support the companion Math 130 class. We will spend class time on in-class exercises to augment the material in Math 130, especially in understanding the ideas that form the foundation for that class's work, and on extra practice for Math 130. 

These exercises are graded based on participation. To earn credit you must show up and you must participate.


Textbook Information
========

There is no textbook associated to this class, but we may on occasion use the (free) textbook for Math 130.


Attendance and Class Participation Guidelines
==========

You are expected to attend class sessions. If you miss a class, it is your responsibility to ensure you make up the missed lesson. The schedule on the course website gives the textbook sections we will cover each week, and any worksheets or handouts will be posted on the course website. If you know in advance you will have to miss a class, please email me.

Mathematics has a reputation for being removed from social concerns and identities. Whether or not this is true for the content of mathematics, it is certainly false  for the process of learning mathematics. Our classroom is to be a welcoming one, where everyone feels able to participate and learn regardless of their background or identity. As learners it is your obligation to treat others with respect and generosity, and be willing to exchange ideas with others.


Communication Policy and Office Hours
=============

Announcements and homework will be posted to the course website. 

The best way to contact me outside of class is by email. Please put "math 013" in the subject line of your email. If I do not respond by the end of the next weekday, please send me a follow up reminder message.

Office hours are held multiple times in the week, to give you an opportunity to ask questions and receive help in-person outside of class time. If you prefer to meet at a different time, please contact me to arrange that.


Accessibility
=============

Students with disabilities are legally entitled to reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to education. I am committed to providing you with equal access to this class, and am happy to work with you to ensure reasonable accommodations. Because the accommodations offered are usually forward-looking modifications, it is important to get them set up as soon as possible.

Anyone who feels they may need accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the [O'Neill Center for Student Access and Support](https://capecod.edu/oneillcenter/) (774-330-4453; `oneillcenter@capecod.edu`)

The Americans with Disabilities Act defines a disability as a medical condition that substantially limits one or more major life activities—including things like walking, sleeping, taking care of yourself, learning, and regulating your emotions—or major bodily functions. If you have a medical condition—including mental health conditions—that significantly interferes with your schoolwork, you probably qualify. You do not need to disclose your condition to your instructors to receive accommodations. 

Academic Honesty and AI Policy
========

You are expected to know and uphold the college’s policies on academic honesty as described in the Student Handbook. Mathematics classes form part of the core base of skills you need to succeed in many later classes, and you are harming yourself if you try to avoid learning the material for this class.

The point of this class is to learn fundamental skills to serve you later in your education and career. AI tools interfere with this goal. For that reason, the use of ChatGPT or other AI tools to produce or help produce material you turn in for a grade is prohibited. Submitted work using these tools will receive a zero, with no chance for making up the lost points. I reserve the right to escalate the consequences for repeated violations.

The following are examples of prohibited AI use:

* Submitted work entirely generated by an LLM.

* Asking Claude to solve a homework problem for you, then writing up its solution.

* Using ChatGPT to draft a paper.

Outside of work you submit for a grade I am not interested in policing your use of AI. If you want to use AI tools to help you take notes, generate extra practice problems before an exam, or similar then that is none of my business.

You are encouraged to collaborate with classmates for homework, but the work you submit is expected to be your own. If you do work with others, please say so and give their names with your submitted homework.
