Announcements
-------------

* (10/24) As I mentioned at the beginning of class, I'm doing an informal mid-semester evaluation to give you an opportunity to give feedback on my teaching. You can find it [here](https://goo.gl/forms/XOJKcndksYqGdrr93). Participation is optional, but please respond by next Monday. As a reminder, the Google form is set up to not record your email address. Mahalo!

* (10/24) Math majors: The group advising session is the coming Monday, from 5 to 6:30pm. See [this flyer]({{ page.url }}SPRING2019_UndergradMATHAdvisingFlyer.pdf) for more information.

* (10/8) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently released a [report](http://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/) which shows that there is a high risk of climate change-related crisis as early as 2040. For a summary of the report, see [this New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-climate-report-2040.html).

* (10/4) Visualizing complex functions is hard, since their inputs and outputs are both points in the plane, and we only have three spatial dimensions in our world. A clever workaround is to use colors. Hue represents the argument of the output while intensity represents the norm of the output. Check out [this great webpage](http://users.mai.liu.se/hanlu09/complex/domain_coloring.html) by Hans Lundmark at Linköping University. His page explains how this works, and gives visualizations of some common complex functions, including the exponential and trig functions. It also mixes in some nice explanations about some cool facts about complex analytic functions, supported by the visualizations.

* (9/19) I put up a [study guide]({{ page.url }}sg1.pdf) for the first midterm. (9/24: fixed a couple typos.) Solutions: (3) $\log(6x^2 + 3y^2 + 4x + 2y + 1) = \sqrt 2 \arctan(\sqrt 2 \frac{x+1/3}{y-1/3}) + C$. (4) $y^4/4 - e^y = x^3 + e^x + C$. (5) $y^4(4x/y + 1)^3 = 1$. (6) $x\sin y + y \cos x = 0$. (7) $ye^{x+y} + e^x = C$. 

* (8/22) The university will be closed Thursday and Friday, so we will not meet Friday and Friday's homework will be due the subsequent Monday.

* (8/20) Tentatively, the midterm dates will be: 

    * Midterm 1: Friday, September 28.

    * Midterm 2: Wednesday, November 21.

Homework
--------

I will grade from among the bolded or starred problems.

* Week 1 (Due Monday Aug 27) 

    1. Exercise 1.3 (page 5) from the textbook.

    2. \*\*\* A petri dish of bacteria has 1000 cells at time $t = 0$. At time $t = 10$ it has 6 billion cells. Write an equation describing the size of sample at time $t$, assuming that the rate of growth is proportional to the size.
	
    3. The inventor of chess was invited before the king, an avid chess player. Excited with the many hours of thrill he had obtained from the game, the king offered the inventor a reward. She replied that she was but a humble woman, and only wanted grains of rice for her reward. She asked for one grain of rice for the first square of the chessboard, two grains for the second square, four grains for the third square, and so on, doubling each time for the sixty-four squares of the chessboard. Thinking that he was getting a good deal, the king readily agreed to her request. How stupid was the king? Express your answer in number of grains of rice. Write a formula which gives the general solution for an $n$ by $n$ chessboard. Think about Carl Sagan's statement that "exponentials can't go on forever, because they will gobble up everything" (Carl Sagan, *Billions and Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium*, p. 17).
	
	4. \*\*\* Read Lesson 2 of the textbook and review the material therein. Write the sentence "I read Lesson 2 and understand the material from that lesson." and sign it with your name. 

* Week 2 (Due Friday, August 31)

    1. Exercises 3.1, **3.2.(a–e)**, **3.4.(b)**.

    2. Exercises 4.1, **4.2**, 4.3.


* Week 3 (Due Friday, September 7)

    1. Exercises from Lesson 6: 2, 5, **7**, 10, 11, **12**, 15, **17**, **20**, 21

    2. *** You have a 15,000 gallon pool. You want it to have the salinity of seawater, 35 parts per thousand of salt per water, which comes out to .3 lb of salt for each gallon of water. You miscalculated the size of your pool and put in 5500 lb of salt, which is too much. To fix this, you drain the pool at the rate of 5 gallons per minute while simultaneously filling it with fresh water at the rate of 5 gallons per minute. Meanwhile, you constantly stir the water to keep it the salt distribution uniform. Write a differential equation which describes the change in the quantity $s$ of salt in the pool (in pounds) at time $t$ (in minutes). Solve this differential equation to determine how long you need to drain the pool and refill it with fresh water to reach the optimal salt level of 4500 lb.
