    2. \*\*\* A petri dish of bacteria has 1000 cells at time $t = 0$. At time $t = 10$ it has 6 billion cells. Write an equation describing the size of sample at time $t$, assuming that the rate of growth is proportional to the size.
	
    3. The inventor of chess was invited before the king, an avid chess player. Excited with the many hours of thrill he had obtained from the game, the king offered the inventor a reward. She replied that she was but a humble woman, and only wanted grains of rice for her reward. She asked for one grain of rice for the first square of the chessboard, two grains for the second square, four grains for the third square, and so on, doubling each time for the sixty-four squares of the chessboard. Thinking that he was getting a good deal, the king readily agreed to her request. How stupid was the king? Express your answer in number of grains of rice. Write a formula which gives the general solution for an $n$ by $n$ chessboard. Think about Carl Sagan's statement that "exponentials can't go on forever, because they will gobble up everything" (Carl Sagan, *Billions and Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium*, p. 17).
	
	4. \*\*\* Read Lesson 2 of the textbook and review the material therein. Write the sentence "I read Lesson 2 and understand the material from that lesson." and sign it with your name.
