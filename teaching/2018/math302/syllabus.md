Grading Policy
=======

Grades will be assigned based upon the standard F to A scale: [93,100] A; [90,93) A-; [87-90) B+; [83,87) B; [80,83) B-; [77,80) C+; [73,77) C; [70,73) C-; [67,70) D+; [63,67) D; [60,63) D-; [0,60) F. I reserve the right to assign higher grades, based upon circumstance and student effort.

The breakdown for your grade is as follows:

* 25% homework

* 25% midterm 1

* 25% midterm 2

* 25% final exam

Attendance Policy
==========

You are expected to attend every class. I advise you to exchange contact info with classmates so that you can share notes in case you have to miss class.


Homework Policy
========

Assigned homework can be found on the [course website]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/2018/math302/). Homework will be collected once a week, on Fridays. The work you turn in is expected to be your own.

Homework will be graded 20% on completion, and 80% based upon a selection of problems from the assignment. For each homework assignment I tell you a small subset of the assigned problems that I will choose from for grading. You must still do all the assignment for the 20% completion points!

Homework should be clearly written, so that I can follow the logical steps you take. Each problem should end with the final answer appropriately formulated and circled.

There will be no acceptance of late homework. If you will miss class, make arrangements to either submit your homework early to me or have another student turn it in for you.

I will drop your lowest two homework scores from the calculation of your grade.

Exam Policy
====

There will be two midterms, and a cumulative final exam. **There will be no make-up exams.** If you will be absent for an exam, contact me in advance so that we can schedule an alternate, earlier, time for you to take the exam.

Tentative midterm dates:

* Midterm 1: Friday, September 28.

* Midterm 2: Wednesday, November 21.

Final exams will not be given early.

Academic Honesty
========

Cheating, plagiarism, and other forms of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated.
