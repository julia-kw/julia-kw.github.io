**Class Meets** MWF 1:30–2:20

**Room** Keller Hall 303

See [here]({{ page.url }}syllabus) for the syllabus.

Announcements
-------------

* (9/3) Here are some online resources for graphing functions of two variables, which can be useful in visualizing what's going on. I highly recommend referencing them while doing your homework.

    * [WolframAlpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/). You can easily [plot graphs](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+2sin+x+cos+y).

    * You can plot graphs right in google's search bar. The syntax is "plot f(x,y)", where f(x,y) is the function you want to plot. See [a sample plot](https://www.google.com/search?q=plot+2sin(x)cos(y)).

    * If you have access to any of them, Matlab, Maple, and Mathematica all have built-in 3d plotting capabilities.

* (8/22) The university is closed tomorrow and Friday, so we will not meet on Friday.

* (8/22) The tentative dates for the midterms will be:

    * Midterm 1: Friday, September 21.

    * Midterm 2: Friday, November 16.

* (8/20) Please note that I pushed the homework for the first week to be due next week.
