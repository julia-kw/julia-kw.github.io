Grading Policy
=======

The break-down for your grade is as follows:

* 25% Final exam

* 25% Midterm

* 25% In-class work

* 25% Homework

A key goal of this class is to teach you how to write mathematics. A portion of the in-class work and homework will be writing assignments. For these assignments, you will have the opportunity to rewrite your work in response to feedback from me and your peers. Students must adequately complete all writing assignments to pass the course with a ‘D’ or better. Students who do not complete all writing assignments will get a D- or an F and will not earn W Focus credit.

Grades will be assigned based upon the standard F to A scale. I do not anticipate this happening, but I reserve the right to later move the intervals downward if I decide a curve is necessary.

* [93,100] A; 

* [90,93) A-; 

* [87,90) B+; 

* [83,87) B; 

* [80,83) B-; 

* [77,80) C+; 

* [73,77) C; 

* [70,73) C-; 

* [67,70) D+; 

* [63,67) D; 

* [60,63) D-; 

* [0,60) F. 

Class Structure
=====

This class will held virtually, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Class will be held synchronously via zoom at the scheduled times. Class time will be mainly spent on group activities to give you hands on experience with writing mathematics and with thinking mathematically. There will be some lecture, but it will be a minority of class time. I will give reading assignments and post the occasional supplemental video to support the in-class activities. Additionally, there will be weekly homework assignments. For exams, there will be one midterm and one final.


Attendance Policy
==========

It is important that you attend class and participate, for that is a key part of how you will learn the material for this course. Accordingly, a portion of your overall grade from the class will come from participation in class activities.

Exams
=====

There will be one midterm and one final exam. Exams must be taken at [a proctored UH Test Center](https://www.uhonline.hawaii.edu/testcenters), or other proctored site or service (physical or online) approved by the instructor.  

* Midterm: Tuesday, October 13

* Final: To be announced


Homework
======

Weekly homework will be posted on [the main webpage for this course]({{ page.parent }}).

Virtual Office Hours
=======

Office hours will be held virtually, details to be announced.


Academic Honesty
========

Cheating, plagiarism, and other forms of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated.
This holds for every class, but I want to especially emphasize it here. This class is the gateway to most upper division mathematics classes. If you cheat here it will only come back to hurt you in future classes. 

KOKUA Program and Accessibility
=====

Students with disabilities are legally entitled to reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to education. Any student who feels they may need accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the KOKUA Program, the UH Mānoa office for students with disabilities. I am committed to providing students with equal access to this class, and am happy to work with you and KOKUA to ensure reasonable accommodations in my course. Because the accommodations offered are usually forward-looking modifications rather than mitigating poor grades you may have already received due to your disability, it is important to get in touch with the KOKUA Program as soon as you can. Further information and contact details can be found on [their website](http://www.hawaii.edu/kokua/). 

Accessibility is especially saliant when the class is ran virtually and everything is mediated through the use of technology, much of which is not adequately designed with accessibility in mind. I ask that you contact me as soon as possible if there is an accommodation you need for any of the online materials for the class, so that we can get it taken care of as soon as possible.

The ADA defines a disability as a medical condition that substantially limits one or more major life activities—including things like walking sleeping, taking care of yourself, learning, and regulating your emotions—or major bodily functions. If you have a medical condition—including mental health conditions—that significantly interferes with your schoolwork, you probably qualify. You do not need to disclose your condition to your instructors to receive accommodations. 



Counseling and Student Development Center
==========

The [Counseling and Student Development Center](http://www.manoa.hawaii.edu/counseling/) offers confidential counseling services to support students with personal, academic, or career concerns. 


Food Vault Hawaiʻi
====

Groups on campus have organized a food pantry, free to use for students at UH Mānoa. All registered students with a valid student ID may access the food pantry. Further information, including location and schedule, can be found [here](https://www.hawaii.edu/news/2018/11/30/manoa-food-pantry/) or on [this facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/foodvaulthawaii/).
