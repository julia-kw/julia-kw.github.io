Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, class will be held virtually through Zoom. **You must have Zoom installed on a device to attend this class.** You can download Zoom via [the Zoom website](https://zoom.us/). The meeting id and password for the Zoom virtual classroom should have been sent to you by email before the first day of class, and you can also find it on the Laulima site for the course. If you have access to neither of these then please get in contact with me so I can ensure you have the necessary information to participate in the class.

Class structure
=====

Class time will be largely structured in a "flipped classroom" approach. I will post reading assignments and the occasional short video on the Laulima site for you to complete before class time. The lion's share of class time will be spent on giving you hands-on experience with writing and thinking like a mathematician. You are expected to attend these virtual class meetings, and a portion of your overall grade for the class will be based on participation. 

The anticipated average class session will go as follows. We will meet as a whole in the Zoom meeting for the class. There will be a short lecture discussing the material for meeting, giving time for you to ask questions and for us to discuss the material for the session. Then you will split into breakout rooms to work in small groups. This will consume the remainder of the class time. 

Group activities will vary, but you can expect activities like the following: practicing writing mathematics; reading each others' writing to give constructive criticism; working on solving mathematical problems; group discussion activities.

Zoom etiquette
====

To ensure we are all on the same page, I want to briefly discuss etiquette for attending class via Zoom. 

Put simply, you should treat this like attending class in-person as much as possible. Pay attention to the class discussion and work with your groupmates on the problem sessions. Don't be loud or disruptive. Taking notes is a good way to help remember material.

Please be on time to class. I know you are busy and have other classes, so I will strive to start and end class at the scheduled times. 

Guidelines for behavior:

* If you feel comfortable having your webcam on during class, then please do, as I find that being able to see the audience helps me with getting feedback and ensuring you are following along. But it would be invasive to ask you to always have your camera on, so it will not be required.

* Please make sure you have your username and profile picture correctly set.

* When the whole class is in the Zoom room, please mute your mic when you are not speaking. This should not be necessary in the breakout rooms. 

* When speaking, I will strive to have lots of short pauses to give you a chance to interrupt with questions. Please feel free to do so, or use Zoom's raise hand feature if you prefer.

* Use of the chat is strongly encouraged, whether that be to ask questions or to answer your classmates' questions.

* I encourage you to set the Zoom view to grid view, instead of speaker view.

* There is no dress code. (Beyond the obviousâ€”be clothed, etc.)

* There is no ban on food/drink. But please mute your mic so others don't have to hear you chew/slurp.
