Class Structure
=====

This class will held virtually, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Class will be held synchronously via zoom at the scheduled times, via a "flipped classroom" approach. Class time will be spent mainly on problem sessions, giving you hands-on experience with the concepts you need to master for the course. I will post supplemental videos and assign readings for you to complete outside of class. Additionally, there will be weekly online homework thrugh WeBWorK.

Attendance Policy
==========

You learn math by doing it. As class time will be spent on you doing math, this means it is important for you to attend class. Accordingly, a fraction of your overall grade for the class will come from participation in class activities.

Exams
=====

There will be two midterms and one cumulative final exam. Exams must be taken at [a proctored UH Test Center](https://www.uhonline.hawaii.edu/testcenters), or other proctored site or service (physical or online) approved by the instructor.  

* Midterm 1: (tentatively) Thursday, October 1

* Midterm 2: (tentatively) Thursday, November 19

* Final: To be announced


Online Homework
======

You will have weekly online homework through WeBWorK, a free-to-use and open source online homework system. See under announcements on the course webpage for information about how to access the WeBWorK site.


Virtual Office Hours
=======

Office hours will be held virtually, details to be announced.


Academic Honesty
========

Cheating, plagiarism, and other forms of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated.


KOKUA Program and Accessibility
=====

Students with disabilities are legally entitled to reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to education. Any student who feels they may need accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the KOKUA Program, the UH Mānoa office for students with disabilities. I am committed to providing students with equal access to this class, and am happy to work with you and KOKUA to ensure reasonable accommodations in my course. Because the accommodations offered are usually forward-looking modifications rather than mitigating poor grades you may have already received due to your disability, it is important to get in touch with the KOKUA Program as soon as you can. Further information and contact details can be found on [their website](http://www.hawaii.edu/kokua/). 

Accessibility is especially saliant when the class is ran virtually and everything is mediated through the use of technology, much of which is not adequately designed with accessibility in mind. I ask that you contact me as soon as possible if there is an accommodation you need for any of the online materials for the class, so that we can get it taken care of as soon as possible.

The ADA defines a disability as a medical condition that substantially limits one or more major life activities—including things like walking sleeping, taking care of yourself, learning, and regulating your emotions—or major bodily functions. If you have a medical condition—including mental health conditions—that significantly interferes with your schoolwork, you probably qualify. You do not need to disclose your condition to your instructors to receive accommodations. 



Counseling and Student Development Center
==========

The [Counseling and Student Development Center](http://www.manoa.hawaii.edu/counseling/) offers confidential counseling services to support students with personal, academic, or career concerns. 


Food Vault Hawaiʻi
====

Groups on campus have organized a food pantry, free to use for students at UH Mānoa. All registered students with a valid student ID may access the food pantry. Further information, including location and schedule, can be found [here](https://www.hawaii.edu/news/2018/11/30/manoa-food-pantry/) or on [this facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/foodvaulthawaii/).
