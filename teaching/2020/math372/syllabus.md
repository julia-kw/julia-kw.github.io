Attendance Policy
==========

You are expected to attend every class, for that is an important part of learning the material. I advise you to exchange contact info with classmates so that you can share notes in case you have to miss class.

Exams
=====

There will be two midterms and one cumulative final exam. 

* Midterm 1: (tentatively) Friday, Feb 21

* Midterm 2: (tentatively) Wednesday, Apr 8

* Final: Monday, May 11, 12:00–2:00

Group project
=====

As part of this class you will apply your knowledge in a group project. You will apply the statistical tools learned in class to analyze real-world data. Further information about the expectations for the project can be found [on the group project page]({{ page.parent }}group-project/).


Online homework
======


You will have weekly online homework through WeBWorK. The first week of class I will email you instructions on how to access WeBWorK, and I will update this syllabus to also include that information. The first homework will be due no sooner than Friday, Jan 24.


Written Homework
=======

Assigned written homework can be found on the [course website]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/2019/math242/). It will be collected once a week, on Fridays. You are encouraged to discuss homework problems with your classmates, but the work you turn in is expected to be your own.

Homework will be graded 20% on completion, and 80% based upon a selection of problems from the assignment. For each homework assignment I tell you a small subset of the assigned problems that I will choose from for grading. You must still do all the assignment for the 20% completion points! 

Homework should be clearly written, so that I can follow the logical steps you take. Each problem should end with the final answer appropriately formulated and circled.

I do not accept late homework. If you will miss class, make arrangements to either submit your homework early to me or have another student turn it in for you.

That said, I understand that life gets in the way and sometimes homework doesn't get done on time. To accommodate this, I will drop your lowest two homework scores from the final calculation for your grade. If there is something that will cause you to miss more than two weeks worth of homework, please get in contact with me as early as possible.


Academic Honesty
========

Cheating, plagiarism, and other forms of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated.


KOKUA Program and Accessibility
=====

Students with disabilities are legally entitled to reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to education. Any student who feels they may need accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the KOKUA Program, the UH Mānoa office for students with disabilities. I am committed to providing students with equal access to this class, and am happy to work with you and KOKUA to ensure reasonable accommodations in my course. Because the accommodations offered are usually forward-looking modifications rather than mitigating poor grades you may have already received due to your disability, it is important to get in touch with the KOKUA Program as soon as you can. Further information and contact details can be found on [their website](http://www.hawaii.edu/kokua/). 

The ADA defines a disability as a medical condition that substantially limits one or more major life activities—including things like walking sleeping, taking care of yourself, learning, and regulating your emotions—or major bodily functions. If you have a medical condition—including mental health conditions—that significantly interferes with your schoolwork, you probably qualify. You do not need to disclose your condition to your instructors to receive accommodations. 


Counseling and Student Development Center
==========

The [Counseling and Student Development Center](http://www.manoa.hawaii.edu/counseling/) offers confidential counseling services to support students with personal, academic, or career concerns. 


Food Vault Hawaiʻi
====

Groups on campus have organized a food pantry, free to use for students at UH Mānoa. All registered students with a valid student ID may access the food pantry. Further information, including location and schedule, can be found [here](https://www.hawaii.edu/news/2018/11/30/manoa-food-pantry/) or on [this facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/foodvaulthawaii/).
