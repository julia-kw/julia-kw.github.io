**Class Meets** Tuesday/Thursday 10:30â€“11:45 virtually via Zoom


* See [here]({{ page.url }}syllabus) for the syllabus.

* See [here]({{ page.url }}zoom) for information about how the Zoom class meetings are structured. 

* The meeting id and password for the Zoom meeting can be found on the Laulima site for the course. The Laulima site also has the reading assignments and occasional short videos to accompany each class meeting.


Course Outline
------

The content of this course can be broken into four themes. For the most part, the themes will be covered in the order below. But at times we will take an early look at a theme or revisit an earlier theme with knowledge from a later theme.

* I. Logic. The definitions and rules of first-order logic.

* II. Proofs. Strategies for proving mathematical statements, how to write proofs.

* III. The language of mathematics. Sets, relations, functions.

* IV. The limitations of the mathematical method. Alternative definitions, axioms, and rules of logic. How do we determine which are "correct"?
