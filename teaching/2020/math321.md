**Class Meets** Tuesday/Thursday 10:30â€“11:45 virtually via Zoom


* See [here]({{ page.url }}syllabus) for the syllabus.

* See [here]({{ page.url }}zoom) for information about how the Zoom class meetings are structured. 

* The meeting id and password for the Zoom meeting can be found on the Laulima site for the course. The Laulima site also has the reading assignments and occasional short videos to accompany each class meeting.


Course Outline
------

The content of this course can be broken into four themes. For the most part, the themes will be covered in the order below. But at times we will take an early look at a theme or revisit an earlier theme with knowledge from a later theme.

* I. Logic. The definitions and rules of first-order logic.

* II. Proofs. Strategies for proving mathematical statements, how to write proofs.

* III. The language of mathematics. Sets, relations, functions.

* IV. The limitations of the mathematical method. Alternative definitions, axioms, and rules of logic. How do we determine which are "correct"?

Announcements
-------------

* For homework, you are strongly encouraged to use LaTeX. LaTeX is a program for typesetting mathematics, and is the standard in academic math, physics, and compsci. The learning curve can be a bit tough to start, but once you pick up the basics it can be much faster than mucking about with an equation editor. If you haven't used LaTeX before, I suggest using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), a free online LaTeX editor. To help get you started, I made a [template for homework](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ypsrcqntbcrs). 

    The way LaTeX works is, you have a plaintext file which is complied into a pdf. (Overleaf does this part automatically for you.) The commands you put in the plaintext file then determine what shows up in the pdf. For example, to display the inequality $\sqrt[3]{x} \le \frac{x+1}{x^2+1}$ you would write `\sqrt[3]{x} \le \frac{x+1}{x^2+1}$`. The dollar signs say that what goes inside should be typeset as math, not as ordinary English. The various symbols =, +, 1, etc. are interpreted normally, while `\frac` is the fraction command. The next two inputs, as inclosed in braces, are typset to be the numerator and denominator of the fraction. Similarly, `\sqrt` is the square root command. It has an optional input, inclosed in square brackets. In this case, the optional input was used to make it a cube root.

Homework
--------

Homework is due every Thursday by 11:59pm. Each assignment will cover the material from Tuesday of that week and Thursday of the previous week.
