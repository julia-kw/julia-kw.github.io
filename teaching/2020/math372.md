Announcements
-------------

* (3/4) [Here]({{ page.url }}sample_means.R) is the R code I used to generate the handout from class today.

* (2/24) [Here]({{ page.url }}formula-sheet-exam1.pdf) is the formula sheet you will have for the first midterm.

* (2/19) [Here](https://www.r-project.org/) is the home page for the R project. You can find download links and documentation on that site. And [here]({{ page.url }}monte-carlo-pi.r) is the sample program from class today.

* (2/14) Here are some resources about using a calculator or computer to do calculations about normal random variables. [This video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kPmX3nNlyw) explains how to use a TI-83 calculator for the calculations. [This WolframAlpha widget](https://www.wolframalpha.com/widgets/gallery/view.jsp?id=98b17f068d5d9b7668e19fb8ae470841) can be used to calculate probabilities like $P(a < X  < b)$ where $X$ is normally distributed. You may find these useful for homework questions involving normal random variables.

* (2/14) The study guide for the first midterm is [here]({{ page.url}}sg1.pdf).

* (2/12) Here are the topics you should know for the first midterm:

    * Basic definitions and properties of sample spaces, events, probability functions, conditional probability, and independent events.

    * Counting techniques: permutations, combinations.

    * Bayes's theorem.

    * Discrete random variables: calculating probabilities, expected values, variances. Probability distribution functions and cumulative distribution functions.

    * Binomial and Poisson discrete random variables. Poisson processes.

    * Continuous random variables: calculating probabilities, expected values, variances. Probability distribution functions and cumulative distribution functions.

    * Uniform and Normal continuous random variables.


* (2/11) Here is the schedule for important upcoming dates: **The first midterm will be Wednesday, February 26.** It will cover material up to the homework due on Friday, February 21. I have pushed back the due date for the first preliminary report for your projects to Friday, March 6. In the near future I will put up information about what to expect for the exam and this first preliminary report.

* (2/10) Next Monday, February 17, is a federal holiday. The university is closed and class will not be meeting.

* (1/29) If you are a resident of HawaiÊ»i and want to vote in the presidential primary, important dates are coming up soon. The HawaiÊ»i Republican party is not running a primary this year [[link](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/474243-hawaii-gop-cancels-presidential-preference-poll-and-commits-delegates-to)], but the Democratic party is. Starting this year the primary is conducted by mail-in ballots. To vote in the primary you must be a registered voter in the state and a member of the Democratic Party of HawaiÊ»i. You can register to vote [here](https://olvr.hawaii.gov) and enroll in the party [here](https://hawaiidemocrats.org). To receive an early ballot in the mail you must register and enroll by February 18. The final deadline to receive a ballot in the mail is March 8. In-person voting and same-day registration options will also be available on April 4.

* (1/16) The webpage for the online homework can be found [here](https://webwork.oer.hawaii.edu/webwork2/Math_372_Spring_2020_Williams/). Your username is your UH username and your password is initially set to your student ID. Please change your password as soon as possible! Online homework will be due weekly at Sunday 11:59pm, starting next week.

* (1/16) UH is closed next Monday (1/20) in observence of Martin Luther King Day, so class will not be meeting.
