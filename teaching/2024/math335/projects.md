Project Ideas
=======

Here's some suggested topics for the projects, in broad categories. For your project you will have a more narrow focus. (This is because these topics are simply too large to be a single project.) A model project is to take a single theorem, explain the definitions behind it, and give a proof.


* *Ordinal notations.* How do we describe and write down names for larger and larger countable ordinals?

* *Applications of the continuum hypothesis.* There's a number of interesting theorems you can prove by assuming CH, especially about building funky objects on the reals.

* *Cardinal characteristics of the continuum.* There are cardinal numbers, such as the bounding number or the dominating number, which meausure something about the continuum. And you can prove one is smaller/larger than another, even if akin to CH their exact value is not provable.

* *Infinite games.* Set theorists study games with infinitely many innings---whether variants of real games like infinite chess or purely mathematical games.

* *Ultrafilters.* These are abstract measures of largeness used in mathematics and other areas. Possible connections include Arrow's impossibility theorem and Ramsey's theorem.

* *Constructions of $\mathbb R$.* In class we'll see how to construct a copy of $\mathbb N$ using just sets. You can also construct a copy of $\mathbb R$ using sets. The two most popular options are Dedekind cuts and Cauchy sequences.

* *Independence of axioms.* In class we'll talk a little about what it means for one axiom to be independent from others. You might look at some set-theoretic axioms, or you might look in a different area of maths.

* *The axiom of choice.* There's a hierarchy of "choice principles" which are weaker than the full axiom of choice, or you could focus on an equivalent form of the axiom.
