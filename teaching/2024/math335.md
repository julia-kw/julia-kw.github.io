Announcements

* (1/29) Here's some info about LaTeX to get you started. As a reminder, all written submissions for this class must be typeset in LaTeX. I will not accept hand-written work.

    LaTeX is a free and open source typesetting engine. You write a LaTeX document as a plaintext file, which is then compiled into a pdf. Various macros are used to determine formatting and document structure, display mathematical formulae, and so on. If you're going to use LaTeX long term, such as if you plan to go to grad school in math or a closely related field, you should install it on your machine. See [here](https://tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html) for instructions. (Or if you're on linux you can just install it using your distribution's package manager.) Another option people like is to use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), an online editor. To help get you started, I made a [template for your portfolio](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ypsrcqntbcrs). 
	
    [Here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials) is a set of LaTeX tutorials on Overleaf. [Here](https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html) is a handy tool for figuring out the LaTeX command for a math symbol. I will also make the source files for the lecture notes available so that you can use them as reference.
