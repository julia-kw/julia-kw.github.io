**Prerequisite** Mathematics 109 or adequate performance on the mathematics placement exam.

Learning Outcomes
========

This is the first semester in the calculus sequence. We will cover the derivative, limits, continuity, and an introduction to the integral. When you leave this class you should be able to calculate derivatives and simple integrals, demonstrate a strong conceptual understanding of the important notions of calculus, and explain how these notions are formalized mathematically.

Grading Policy
=======

Your learning outcomes for this class will be assessed with exams and homework. The breakdown for your grade across five components is as follows:

* **25%**: Midterm 1

* **25%**: Midterm 2

* **25%**: Oral Final

* **15%**: Problem Sets

* **10%**: Writing Exercises

Grades will be assigned on the standard A through F scale. I reserve the right to make adjustments upward to account for individual circumstance.
	
Homework
========

Homework will be assigned weekly, due in-class the Monday of the following week. The exception for this is review/exam weeks, which will have shorter homework assignments due Wednesday. Homework will consist of problem sets and writing exercises.

Problem sets consist of problems asking you to make a calculation. This is what you probably think of when you hear "math homework". **Show your work!** You do not need to show every minute algebraic step, but I need to be able to follow your thought process. Grading will be 50% based on completion and 50% based on a selection of two problems from the assignment. 

* Rubric for completion

    * 50/50: you did all problems.
	
	* 20/50: you did most the problems.
	
	* 0/50: you did only a few problems.
	
* Rubric for individual problems

    * 25/25: you gave a full correct solution, perhaps modulo a minor error
	
	* 15/25: you were on the right track but were unable to finish or made significant errors
	
	* 0/25: you didn't make meaningful progress toward a correct solution.
	
Writing exercises ask you to explain why a method works or why some mathematical fact is true. As the name suggests, what you turn in should be a piece of writing. You should write in complete paragraphs and adhere to the standards of academic writing. Where you need to write a mathematical formula you should either include inline in the middle of a paragraph or, for important or large formulae, on a separate line. See your textbook for an example of how to write mathematics. **Handwritten writing exercises are preferred; I will only accept electronic/printed submissions which were typeset using LaTeX.**

You are encouraged to work together on homework, but the work you turn in is expected to be your own. If you do collaborate with classmates, please say so and give their names with your submitted work.

For this class you should expect to spend roughly two hours out of class for each hour of in-class time, for a total of six hours. Homework is due weekly to give you flexibility in when to fit in those six hours. That said, I strongly encourage you to start your homework as soon as possible. Material from later in the week will build on earlier ideas. 

If you will not be able to submit your completed homework on Monday, send me an email to let me know it will be late and to let me know when you will get it to me. You can set an extension time up to the end of the week. Late work is not penalized, but I will not accept homework later than the Friday after the due date. 

If exceptional circumstances make it impossible to get work done, please talk to me so we can figure out the best solution for what to do.

Midterms
========

There will be two midterm exams, each scheduled on a Friday. These are in-class, written, individual exams. Most exam problems will be similar to the problem sets, but you should expect one or two writing exercises.

**Unless otherwise stated, no calculators nor notes are allowed for exams.**

Exam dates:

* Midterm 1: **Friday, 9/27**

* Midterm 2: **Friday, 11/8**

Oral Final
====

In place of a written final, I will do oral finals. These will be individually scheduled, one-on-one sessions in my office. You will demonstrate how you work through a few problems, and we will discuss how the class went overall.

I will provide a problem list before the sessions. You will be asked to present one problem of your choice with me choosing the remainder.


Textbook Information
========

The textbook for this class is H. Jerome Keisler, *Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach*, online edition. A pdf of this book is freely available under a [Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported Licensce](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/): [[hosted on my website]({{ page.parentlink }}keisler-ec.pdf)] or [[see Keisler's webpage](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~hkeisler/calc.html)].

There is also a print edition of the book, published by Dover. (ISBN: 978-0486484525) If you prefer a physical copy you can buy it online for about \$30, but be cautious of minor differences between editions.

Most of the homework will be assigned out of the textbook, and from time to time I will ask you to read selections from it. The book is well-written, and it is a good resource for studying on your own or for examples of how to write about mathematics.

Attendance Policy
==========

You are expected to attend class sessions, as per the college attendance policy. No portion of your grade is directly based on attendance, but like most math classes the material in this class builds on itself. If you skip class and fall behind it is difficult to get back on track.

Midterm exams are in-person and you must show up to receive credit. If exceptional circumstance means you cannot make an exam email me as soon as possible so we can set up an alternative. 

If you miss a class, it is your responsibility to ensure you make up the missed lesson. The schedule on the course website gives the textbook sections we will cover each week, and any worksheets or handouts will be posted on the course website. If you know in advance you will have to miss a class, please email me. 

Class Participation Guidelines
=====

Class time will be spent on a combination of lecture and group work/discussion. 

You are expected to participate in all parts of class sessions. For lecture you should be actively listening, taking notes, and asking questions as appropriate. For group work/discussion you should engage in the work, sharing ideas with your classmates.

Mathematics has a reputation for being removed from social concerns and identities. Whether or not this is true for the content of mathematics, it is certainly false  for the process of learning mathematics. Our classroom is to be a welcoming one, where everyone feels able to participate and learn regardless of their background or identity. As learners it is your obligation to treat others with respect and generosity, and be willing to exchange ideas with others.

Communication Policy and Office Hours
=============

Announcements and homework will be posted to the course website. For the gradebook we will use google classroom. 

The best way to contact me outside of class is by email. Please put "math 210" in the subject line of your email.

Office hours are held multiple times in the week, to give you an opportunity to ask questions and receive help in-person outside of class time. If you prefer to meet at a different time, please contact me to arrange that.



Accessibility
=============


Students with disabilities are legally entitled to reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to education. I am committed to providing you with equal access to this class, and am happy to work with you to ensure reasonable accommodations. Because the accommodations offered are usually forward-looking modifications, it is important to get them set up as soon as possible.

Anyone who feels they may need accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact Jeannie Altshuler, Director of Accessibility and Academic
Support, in the Win Commons (`jaltshuler@simons-rock.edu`; 413-528-7383).

The Americans with Disabilities Act defines a disability as a medical condition that substantially limits one or more major life activities—including things like walking, sleeping, taking care of yourself, learning, and regulating your emotions—or major bodily functions. If you have a medical condition—including mental health conditions—that significantly interferes with your schoolwork, you probably qualify. You do not need to disclose your condition to your instructors to receive accommodations. 

Academic Honesty
========

You are expected to know and uphold the college’s policies on academic honesty as described in the Student Handbook. Mathematics classes form part of the core base of skills you need to succeed in many later classes, and you are harming yourself if you try to avoid learning the material for this class.

The use of ChatGPT or other AI tools is prohibited. Submitted work using these tools will receive a zero, with no chance for making up the lost points. I reserve the right to escalate the consequences for repeated violations.

You are encouraged to collaborate with classmates for homework, but the work you submit is expected to be your own. If you do work with others, please say so and give their names with your submitted homework.


Other Campus Resources
=====

The [Wellness Center Health and Counseling Services](https://simons-rock.edu/student-life/living-on-campus/wellness-center.php), as the name says, offers health and counseling services. 

The [Win Student Resources Commons](https://simons-rock.edu/early-college/contact-us/offices-and-departments/win-commons.php) offers academic support, tutoring, accessibility, and career advice.
