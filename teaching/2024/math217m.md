Schedule and topics
--------

This is a seven week half-semester course. The schedule is organized on a weekly basis. Mondays and Wednesdays will be used for lecture and Fridays will be used for group activities and presentations. 

The schedule below is tentative; we might have small adjustments in the dates. 

* Week 1: What is a proof and why do we care? [Chapters 1 and 2]
	
* Week 2: Induction, part 1 [Chapter 4]

* Week 3: Induction, part 2 [Chapter 4]
	
* Week 4: Logic
	
* Week 5: Functions and relations [Chapter 11]
	
* Week 6: Functions and relations [Chapter 11]
	
* Week 7: Wrapup and final
	
	(No class Wednesday 10/16.)
	
Chapters 1, 2, 4, and 11 comprise the core topics for the class. The other chapters are each about a different area of mathematics. As a class we will choose three chapters from 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 15 to look at.
