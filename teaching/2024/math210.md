Writing assignments
-------

* **Week 7** (Due Monday 10/21) Your friend insists that a function can have its maximum occur at two different places without having a minimum. Explain why they are correct by giving an example. Are they still correct if you insist the function be continuous everywhere on its domain? Justify your answer. (Extra credit 1) Consider the function $r(x)$ defined as $r(x) = x$ when $x$ is rational and $r(x) = 0$ when $x$ is irrational. Determine the set of points where $r(x)$ is continuous. (Extra credit 2) Consider a fixed finite set $S = \\{a_1, \ldots, a_n\\}$ of real numbers. Define the function $\chi_S(x)$ as $\chi_S(x) = 1$ if $x$ is an element of $S$ and $\chi_S(x) = 0$ otherwise. Determine the set of points where $\chi_S(x)$ is continuous.

* **Week 6** (Due Monday 10/14) Read pages 29–31 of [Penelope Maddy, "How applied mathematics became pure" (2008)]({{ page.url }}maddyhowapplied.pdf), where she discusses how calculus is used to approximate a discrete reality. Pick one of the problems from section 3.2 you did. Following Maddy's analysis, explain for your specific problem the idealizations and simplifications made to be able to apply calculus.

* **Week 5** *No writing assignment.*

* **Week 4** (Due Monday 9/23) Use logarithmic differentiation to explain why the quotient rule for derivatives works. (Extra credit) Use the inverse function rule to explain why the rules for arcsin and arccos work.

* **Week 3** (Due Monday 9/16) [See here, page 2.]({{ page.url }}hw3.pdf)

* **Week 2** (Due Monday 9/9). Consider the step function $u(x)$ defined as $u(x) = 0$ if $x \le 0$ and $u(x) = 1$ if $x > 0$. Determine where $u(x)$ is differentiable and justify your answer. (Extra credit) Find the derivative of $f(x) = \lvert x^2 - 1 \rvert$, identifying where $f(x)$ is not differentiable. Justify your answer.

* **Week 1** (Due Monday 9/2). Write up an explanation for problem #25 and (extra credit) #26 on page 42.

Readings
--------

* *By Wednesday 8/28.* Skim sections 1.1 through 1.3 and confirm that you know all the concepts therein.

Schedule
--------

This course is organized into three units. Units 1 and 2 each end in a midterm, while unit 3 ends in an oral final. Homework consists of problem sets and writing exercises, and is on a weekly schedule due Mondays. (Exam weeks have an adjusted schedule.)

The schedule below is tentative; we might have small adjustments in the dates. For each week I've included which sections from the textbook we will be covering.
