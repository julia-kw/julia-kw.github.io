**Textbook** Ron Larson and Laurie Bosewll, *Algebra 1*, 2022 edition (ISBN: 978-1-64727-416-0)

**Course Description** Algebra IIT is a second course to continue studies in the basics of Algebra. The course covers topics in adding/subtracting and factoring polynomials, graphing quadratic functions, determining the domain and range of functions with radicals, graphing the different exponential functions and solving exponential equations. This course offers a faster pace than MATH 01B, so, in addition to completing algebra fundamentals, students will learn about logarithmic functions and their properties and the basics of trigonometry, including right-triangle trigonometry, unit circle fundamentals, and the graphs of trigonometric functions sine, cosine, and tangent. This course prepares students for Geometry and college mathematics.

**Prerequisite** MATH 01A or equivalent placement. 

Learning Outcomes
========

This is the second semester in the academy algebra sequence, at an accelerated pace and also covering trigonometry. When you leave this class you should have the mathematical background necessary for college-level math and science classes. You will be able to perform symbolic and numeric calculations, understand the concepts that underlie these calculations, and apply this mathematical knowledge to reason about quantities in other domains.

Grading Policy
=======

Your mastery of the class material will be assessed via multiple categories, and your grades in the categories will be aggregated for your overall course grade. The breakdown is as follows.

* **40%**: Quizzes

* **20%**: Oral Final

* **20%**: Homework

* **10%**: In-Class Activities

* **10%**: Reflections

Grades will be assigned on the standard A through F scale. I reserve the right to make adjustments to account for individual circumstance.

Details about these categories are below.

Quizzes
=======

There will be four in-class quizzes. Each quiz will consist of a series of questions. Some will ask you to explain concepts in writing while others will ask you to perform calculations. 

Additionally, you will have the chance to make up questions during later quiz periods. Retake questions from previous quizzes will be given, and your grade on them will replace your lowest scored questions on the corresponding previous quiz. For example, if on quiz 1 your lowest two questions scored 0/10 and 4/10 and on the retake questions you scored 8/10 and 10/10 then I would replace the 0 and 2 with 8 and 10 in my gradebook.

Calculational questions will be graded on a 0/4/8/10 scale:

* **10.** All good!

* **8.** Mostly correct, but with minor errors.

* **4.** Major errors or incomplete.

* **0.** No meaningful work.

Notes, calculators, and electronic devices are not allowed for quizzes. 
	
	
Oral Final
====

At the end of the semester you will schedule individual meetings with me to discuss how the class went and for you to demonstrate your mastery of the course material. Before these sessions, I will put up a list of problems and you will do a selection of the problems in-person for me.

Homework
========

You will have weekly homework, due on Fridays, to practice the class material. While homework is due weekly, work is assigned for each class period. You should do Monday's homework before Tuesday's class, and similar for other days.

Some homework will be through an online system, other homework I will ask you to turn in on paper. 

Information about how to access the online system will be sent to you by email.

In-Class Activities
========

On most Fridays we will do activities to more deeply explore the mathematics we've learned earlier in the week or to see how it applies outside of pure math. Your completion of these activities will make up this portion of your grade.

Reflections
===========

An important part of education is to continually reflect on your learning process. Weekly on Fridays you will complete a short reflection where you self-evaluate how you are doing in the class.

Textbook Information
========

We will use Ron Larson and Laurie Bosewll, *Algebra 1*, 2022 edition (ISBN: 978-1-64727-416-0) as our main textbook. When we cover trigonometry we will use Jay Abramson, *Algebra and Trigonometry*, 2nd edition (ISBN: 978-1-951693-40-4) [[link](https://openstax.org/details/books/algebra-and-trigonometry-2e) as a supplemental resource. This book is freely available to download online, or you can purchase a paper copy if you prefer.

Attendance Policy and Classroom Expectations
==========

You are expected to attend every class session, as per the academy attendance policy. If you must miss class, it is your responsibility to let me know and to follow along with the material on your own.

You should come prepared to every class meeting. Bring paper, a writing utensil, and the workbook for the class. Be respectful of your classmates. Refrain from behaving in ways that are an impediment to their learning. Unless otherwise stated, the use of electronic devices during class time is prohibited, with the exception of calculators or if you need a device for an accommodation. (See Accessibility and Inclusion below.) If there is an emergency and you need to use a phone please step out of the classroom to do so.


Communication Policy and Office Hours
=============

Announcements and written homework will be posted to the course website. 

The best way to contact me outside of class is by email. Please put "math 02" in the subject line of your email.

Office hours are held multiple times in the week, to give you an opportunity to ask questions and receive help in-person outside of class time. If you prefer to meet at a different time, please contact me to arrange that.


Accessibility and Inclusion
=============

Everyone has equal access to this class, regardless of disability, background, or identity. Mathematics has a reputation for being removed from social concerns and identities. Whether or not this is true for the content of mathematics, it is certainly false  for the process of learning mathematics. Our classroom is to be a welcoming one, where everyone feels able to participate and learn. As learners it is your obligation to treat others with respect and generosity, and be willing to exchange ideas with others.

Students with disabilities are legally entitled to reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to education. I am happy to work with you to ensure reasonable accommodations. Because the accommodations offered are usually forward-looking modifications, it is important to get them set up as soon as possible.

Anyone who feels they may need accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact Jeannie Altshuler, Director of Accessibility and Academic
Support, in the Win Commons (`jaltshuler@simons-rock.edu`; 413-528-7383).

The Americans with Disabilities Act defines a disability as a medical condition that substantially limits one or more major life activities—including things like walking, sleeping, taking care of yourself, learning, and regulating your emotions—or major bodily functions. If you have a medical condition—including mental health conditions—that significantly interferes with your schoolwork, you probably qualify. You do not need to disclose your condition to your instructors to receive accommodations. 

Academic Honesty
========

You are expected to know and uphold the college’s policies on
academic honesty as described in the Student Handbook. For many majors, mathematics classes form part of the core base of skills you need to succeed in later classes, and you are harming the future version of yourself if you try to avoid learning the material for this class.

You are encouraged to work and study together with your classmates. But all work you submit must be your own.

Other Campus Resources
=====

The [Wellness Center Health and Counseling Services](https://simons-rock.edu/student-life/living-on-campus/wellness-center.php), as the name says, offers health and counseling services. 

The [Win Student Resources Commons](https://simons-rock.edu/early-college/contact-us/offices-and-departments/win-commons.php) offers academic support, tutoring, accessibility, and career advice.
