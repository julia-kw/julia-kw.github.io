Homework
========

See the syllabus for information about my grading policy for the class, and a template .tex file. Some exercises are marked as "reach exercises". These are optional, more difficult problems. You are encouraged to attempt them, but I won't penalize your grade if you don't.

**Please do not use blue ink for your assignments. I would like to reserve blue for grading and writing comments. If you use blue, I will be forced to switch to the angrier, more aggressive red.**
