\begin{exercise}
Show that there is no bijection between $\Nbb$ and $\Rbb$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
It was proven in class on Tuesday, August 27 that $\Rbb$ is in bijective correspondence with $\powerset(\Nbb)$. Accordingly, it suffices to prove that there is no bijection between $\Nbb$ and $\powerset(\Nbb)$. To this end, consider an arbitrary function $f \colon \Nbb \to \powerset(\Nbb)$. Define $D \subseteq \Nbb$ as $D = \{ n \in \Nbb : n \not \in f(n) \}$. I claim that $D$ is not in the range of $f$. To see this, suppose it were the case that $D = f(n)$ for some $n$. If $n \in D$, then by the definition of $D$ we would have that $n \not \in f(n) = D$, a contradiction. On the other hand, if $n \not \in D = f(n)$, then again by by the definition of $D$ we would have that $n \in D$. Either way, we get a contradiction. So it must be that our arbitrary $f$ is not surjective, and hence fails to be bijective.

\begin{exercise}
Show that if $X \subseteq \Rbb$ then either $X$ injects into $\Nbb$ or else $\Rbb$ injects into $X$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
I was unable to find a proof of this assertion in full generality. However, I was able to prove it in the case where $X$ contains a nondegenerate interval. 

Suppose $X$ contains a nondegenerate interval $I$. By shrinking $I$ if necessary, we way assume without loss that $I$ is an open interval, that is of the form $(a,b)$. Observe that $(a,b)$ is in bijective correspondence with with $(0,1)$, simply by shifting and rescaling. Thus, $(a,b)$ is in bijective correspondence with any other interval. Next, note that restricting the tangent function gives a bijection from $(-\pi/2, \pi/2)$ to $\Rbb$. Composing these bijections we get that $(a,b)$ is in bijective correspondence with $\Rbb$. This then yields an injection of $\Rbb$ into $X$.
