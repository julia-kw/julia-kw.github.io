Announcements
-------------

* (10/8) I have elected to put the curve in the distribution for assigning letter grades, rather than in your exam scores. See the syllabus for the new distribution.

* (9/30) [Here]({{ page.url }}formula-sheet.pdf) is the formula sheet you will be given for the first midterm.

* (9/27) [Here]({{ page.url }}spring19-midterm1.pdf) is the first midterm from last semester's math 242. It is similar to what you should expect for your upcoming exam.

* (9/24) As a reminder, the first midterm will be next Thursday, October 3, at 6pm in Webster Hall Room 203. Here are the topics you should understand:

    * How a function $f$ and its inverse function $f^{-1}$ relate. Be able to use both formulae and graphs to calculate $f^{-1}(a)$, $(f^{-1})'(a)$, and the domain/range of $f^{-1}$. 

    * How to simplify expressions involving logarithms and exponential functions.

    * How to differentiate and integrate logarithms and exponential functions.

    * How to simply expressions involving trig functions and inverse trig functions.

    * How to differentiate and integrate functions involving inverse trig functions.

    * How to analyze exponential growth/decay.

    * When and how to apply L'Hôpital's rule.

    * How to use integration by parts.

    * How to solve integrals involving products of powers of trig functions.

    * How to solve integrals using trigonometric substitution.

    * You are also expected to remember material from calculus I, especially the chain rule, the product rule, and how to do integration by substitution.

* (9/18) Quizes will be on Thursdays hereon out.

* (9/9) I have elected to not count your quiz from last week (week 2) toward your final grade in the class.

* (9/6) The schedule for the extra recitation sessions for the Early Access Program is now available. You do not need to attend multiple sessions per week. Each week you'll be dealing with one worksheet, cyclying to the next worksheet every Thursday. All sessions meet in Keller 403.

    * Monday: 3–4pm

    * Tuesday: 4–5pm

    * Wednesday: 4–5pm

    * Thursday: 3–4pm

    * Friday: 4–5pm

* (8/28) The tutor program resumes operation startion today, in the Learning Emporium, located in Bilger Addition 209. Tutors will be available Monday–Friday, noon–4:30 pm (but only one tutor per period). 
The full program with expanded hours and more tutors per period will be announced later.
A precise schedule will be posted in K418, on the Bulletin Board outside  K401A, on the door of BA209 and at various strategic locations.
