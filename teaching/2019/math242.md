Course Outline
------

* Chapter 6 (with the starred sections)

* Chapter 7

* Chapter 11

* Chapter 9

Announcements
-------------

* (12/11) **The final exam will be held in Hawaii Institute of Geophysics, Room 110.** It will not be held in Keller 302, the usual room for lecture.

* (12/4) You can see your tentative grades going into the final [here]({{ page.url }}242-grades-prefinal.pdf). ~~This does not yet include your last three homework assignments nor the recitation for next week, nor have I yet dropped your lowest two homework grades/two recitation absences. Nevertheless, this should give you a pretty accurate view of where you currently are in the class.~~ Now taking into account all homework and recitations.

* (12/2) **The final exam will be Wednesday, December 18 at 12:00â€“2:00pm.** You can find final exams from previous semesters [here](http://math.hawaii.edu/wordpress/calculus-final-exams-and-review-problems/). The formula sheet you get will be the same as on the most recent final.

* (11/15) Starting next week (Nov. 18) the LAs for Math 242 will have to adjust the meeting times for the extra recitations. The schedule is:

    * Tuesday 3-5.

    * Wednesday 4-5.

    * Thursday 3-4.

    *Friday 4-5.

    All extra recitations will be in Keller 403. Any student is invited to participate.



* (11/4) As a reminder, the first midterm will be next Thursday, November 7, at 6pm in Webster Hall Room 203. Here are the topics you should understand:

    * How to decompose a rational expression into partial fraction form.

    * How to use partial fraction decomposition to integrate a rational function.

    * How to approximately calculate a definite integral using the midpoint rule, the trapezoidal rule, and Simpson's rule.

    * How to calculate error bounds for the approximations by these three rules.

    * How to calculate improper integrals.

    * What it means for a sequence to converge and how to determine the limit of a sequence.

    * What a series is and how it differs from a sequence, what it means for a series to converge.

    * How to tell whether a $p$-series or geometric series is convergent, and if convergent how to calculate its sum.

    * What a telescoping series is and how to calculate its sum.

    * How to use the integral test to determine whether a series converges.

    * How to use the comparison test and limit comparison test to check whether a series converges or diverges.

    For the exam you will not be allowed notes nor a calculator. However, you will be given a formula sheet, which you can see [here]({{ page.url }}exam2-formulae.pdf). And [here]({{ page.url }}exam2-practice.pdf) is a selection of practice problems for the exam.

* (10/28) Starting today, the LAs for Math 242 will be offering extra recitations focusing on material recently covered in class. Any student is invited to participate. The extra recitations will meet in Keller 403. The schedule is:

    * Monday and Thursday 3:00â€“4:00pm.

    * Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday 4:00â€“5:00pm. 

    These will run for the rest of the semester (subject to change, in which case you'll get another announcement).

* (10/21) You may find [this flowchart from xkcd](https://xkcd.com/2117/) about integration helpful.

* (10/9) As you may recall from the syllabus, as part of the Early Access Program, learning assistants for Math 242 are offering extra recitations starting after the first midterm. The schedule for the extra recitations is:

    * Monday: 3:00â€“4:30pm in Keller 403

    * Tuesday: 4:10â€“5:15pm in Keller 303

    * Wednesday: 4:10â€“5:30pm in Keller 302 

    * Thursday: 3:00â€“4:00pm in Keller 403

    * Friday: 4:00â€“6:00pm in Keller 302

    These will run from Wednesday Oct 9 to Wednesday Oct. 23, and focus on material covered up to the first exam.

    Students who under-performed on the midterm and attend these extra recitations may be permitted to retake the first midterm, for a maximum replacement score of 46. To take part in the retake, a student needs to have scored less than 46 on the first midterm, and needs to attend a total of  five hours of extra recitations (over the 2 week period). 

    The retake will take place on the evening of Thursday Oct. 24 at a time and place to be announced. Following the retake of the exam, additional recitations will still be offered, although the schedule will change.

* (10/8) I have elected to put the curve in the distribution for assigning letter grades, rather than in your exam scores. See the syllabus for the new distribution.

* (9/30) [Here]({{ page.url }}formula-sheet.pdf) is the formula sheet you will be given for the first midterm.

* (9/27) [Here]({{ page.url }}spring19-midterm1.pdf) is the first midterm from last semester's math 242. It is similar to what you should expect for your upcoming exam.

* (9/24) As a reminder, the first midterm will be next Thursday, October 3, at 6pm in Webster Hall Room 203. Here are the topics you should understand:

    * How a function $f$ and its inverse function $f^{-1}$ relate. Be able to use both formulae and graphs to calculate $f^{-1}(a)$, $(f^{-1})'(a)$, and the domain/range of $f^{-1}$. 

    * How to simplify expressions involving logarithms and exponential functions.

    * How to differentiate and integrate logarithms and exponential functions.

    * How to simply expressions involving trig functions and inverse trig functions.

    * How to differentiate and integrate functions involving inverse trig functions.

    * How to analyze exponential growth/decay.

    * When and how to apply L'HÃ´pital's rule.

    * How to use integration by parts.

    * How to solve integrals involving products of powers of trig functions.

    * How to solve integrals using trigonometric substitution.

    * You are also expected to remember material from calculus I, especially the chain rule, the product rule, and how to do integration by substitution.

* (9/18) Quizes will be on Thursdays hereon out.

* (9/9) I have elected to not count your quiz from last week (week 2) toward your final grade in the class.

* (9/6) The schedule for the extra recitation sessions for the Early Access Program is now available. You do not need to attend multiple sessions per week. Each week you'll be dealing with one worksheet, cyclying to the next worksheet every Thursday. All sessions meet in Keller 403.

    * Monday: 3â€“4pm

    * Tuesday: 4â€“5pm

    * Wednesday: 4â€“5pm

    * Thursday: 3â€“4pm

    * Friday: 4â€“5pm

* (8/28) The tutor program resumes operation startion today, in the Learning Emporium, located in Bilger Addition 209. Tutors will be available Mondayâ€“Friday, noonâ€“4:30 pm (but only one tutor per period). 
The full program with expanded hours and more tutors per period will be announced later.
A precise schedule will be posted in K418, on the Bulletin Board outside  K401A, on the door of BA209 and at various strategic locations.
