Attendance Policy
==========

You are expected to attend every class, for that is an important part of learning the material. I advise you to exchange contact info with classmates so that you can share notes in case you have to miss class.

Homework Policy
========

Assigned homework can be found on the [course website]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/2019/math244/). Homework will be collected once a week, on Thursdays. The work you turn in is expected to be your own.

Homework will be graded 20% on completion, and 80% based upon a selection of problems from the assignment. For each homework assignment I tell you a small subset of the assigned problems that I will choose from for grading. You must still do all the assignment for the 20% completion points! 

Homework should be clearly written, so that I can follow the logical steps you take. Each problem should end with the final answer appropriately formulated and circled.

I do not accept late homework. If you will miss class, make arrangements to either submit your homework early to me or have another student turn it in for you.

That said, I understand that life gets in the way and sometimes homework doesn't get done on time. To accommodate this, I will drop your lowest two homework scores from the final calculation for your grade.

Quiz Policy
====

There will be weekly quizes, in class on Tuesdays. No make-up quizes will be given, but I will drop your lowest two quiz scores from the final calculation for your grade.

Exam Policy
====

There will be two midterms, dates to be announced, and a cumulative final exam. **There will be no make-up exams.** If you will be absent for an exam, contact me in advance so that we can schedule an alternate, earlier, time for you to take the exam.

Final exams will not be given early. 

**No calculators nor other electronic devices are allowed on exams.**

Academic Honesty
========

Cheating, plagiarism, and other forms of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated.

KOKUA Program
=====

Any student who feels they may need accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the KOKUA Program, the UH Mānoa office for students with disabilities. I am happy to work with you and KOKUA to ensure reasonable accommodations in my course. Further information and contact details can be found on [their website](http://www.hawaii.edu/kokua/). 


Counseling and Student Development Center
==========

The [Counseling and Student Development Center](http://www.manoa.hawaii.edu/counseling/) offers confidential counseling services to support students with personal, academic, or career concerns.

* Stewart passed away in 2014, but that hasn't stopped Cengage from continuing to publish new editions of his textbook, with slight tweaks and incompatibilities to force students to buy the latest edition. You may enjoy [learning that](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/article-torontos-famed-integral-house-up-for-sale-again/) the house he had built with money from textbook sales recently went on the market with an asking price of over twenty million Canadian dollars.
