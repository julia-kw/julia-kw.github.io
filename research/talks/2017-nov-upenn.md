title: "Strong second-order set theories do not have least transitive models"

This is a talk at the University of Pennsylvania Logic and Computation Seminar on 13 November 2017. See also [their page](https://www.math.upenn.edu/events/strong-second-order-set-theories-do-not-have-least-transitive-models) for the talk.

Shepherdson and Cohen independently showed that (if there is any transitive model of $\mathsf{ZFC}$) there is a least transitive model of $\mathsf{ZFC}$. That is, there is a transitive set $M$ so that $(M,\in) \models \mathsf{ZFC}$ and if $N$ is any transitive model of $\mathsf{ZFC}$ then $M \subseteq N$. We can ask the same question for theories extending $\mathsf{ZFC}$. For some fixed set theory $T$, does $T$ have a least transitive model?

I will look at this question where $T$ is a second-order set theory.  Two major second-order set theories of interest are Gödel–Bernays set theory $\mathsf{GBC}$ and Kelley–Morse set theory $\mathsf{KM}$. The weaker of the two is $\mathsf{GBC}$, which is conservative over $\mathsf{ZFC}$ while $\mathsf{KM}$ is much stronger.

As an immediate corollary of the Shepherdson–Cohen result we get that there is a least transitive model of $\mathsf{GBC}$. The case for $\mathsf{KM}$ is more difficult and indeed, has a negative answer. I will show that there is no least transitive model of $\mathsf{KM}$. Along the way we will build Gödel's constructible universe above sets and into the proper classes, unroll models of second-order set theory into first-order models, and dip our toes into Barwise theory and the admissible cover. Time permitting I will mention some results and open questions about $\mathsf{GBC}$ + Elementary Transfinite Recursion, which is intermediate between $\mathsf{GBC}$ and $\mathsf{KM}$ in strength.
