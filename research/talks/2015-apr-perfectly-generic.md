This is a talk about perfect generics at CUNYâ€™s MoPA seminar on 22 April 2015.

We will look at perfect generics for countable models of PA. Our goal will be to prove the following theorems: (1) Any countable collection of inductive subsets of a countable model are definable from a single generic. (2) Any countable model has minimally undefinable generics.
