title: Minimal models of Kelleyâ€“Morse set theory
permalink: /research/talks/2016-june-best/

This is a talk at the [Boise Extravaganza in Set Theory](http://diamond.boisestate.edu/~best/), part of the 97th annual meeting of the AAAS Pacific Division on 15 June 2016. (BEST originated, as one might expect, in Boise, Idaho, but later went on the road.)

A well-known result is that there is a minimal transitive model of ZFC. In this talk I look at the analogous question for second-order set theories. That there is a minimal transitive model of GBC follows immediately from the result from ZFC but the KM case is more difficult. The main result I will present is that the question for KM has a negative answer: there is no least transitive model of KM. Along the way, we will look at another notion of minimality for models of second-order set theory and see that KM does not have minimal models in this other respect.
