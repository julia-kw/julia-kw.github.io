title: Recursive definability of the standard cut

This is a talk at CUNYâ€™s MoPA seminar on 28 October 2015.

Say that the standard cut in a model of arithmetic is recursively definable if there is a recursive sequence coinitial in the nonstandard elements. We will construct minimal models in which the standard cut is recursively definable and minimal models in which the standard cut is not recursively definable.
