This is an talk at the [Simon's Rock mathematics colloquium]({{ site.url }}/seminars/SR-colloquium) on 24 September 2024.

[[slides]({{ page.url }}infinite.pdf)]

What does it mean to be finite? To be infinite? Why does the axiom of choice come into the picture? What even is the axiom of choice? What weird and exciting things happen when we try to generalize the ideas which answer these questions? We will discuss these questions and more.
