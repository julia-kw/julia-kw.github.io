title: A conceptual overview of forcing

This is a talk in the UH Mānoa Mathematical Logic seminar on Monday, September 10 at 2:30pm.

Paul Cohen—who visited UH Mānoa in the 1990s—introduced the method of forcing to prove that the failure of the continuum hypothesis is consistent with ZFC, the standard base axioms for set theory. Since then it has become a cardinal tool within set theory, being the main method for proving independence results and even enjoys use in proving ZFC results. In this talk I will give an introduction to forcing, focusing on the big picture ideas.

This talk is a sequel to [my previous talk]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/talks/2018-aug-universes-of-sets) and a prequel to [my next talk]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/talks/2018-sept-computational-forcing).
