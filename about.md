Hi! I am a logician and mathematician, currently at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Sam Houston State University.

When citing me or otherwise talking about me in professional contexts, please use they/them/their for pronouns.

My research interests specialize in set theory, with much of my work motivated by aspects of the multiversist view of set theory, advocated by Hamkins and others. Outside of pure set theory, I'm interested in its connections to other areas of logic and to philosophy of mathematics. For my teaching, while logic is an interdisciplinary subject, so far I have only had opportunity to teach in mathematics departments. In such, I've taught a broad range of classes, from freshman pre-calculus to the graduate level.

Some miscellaneous factoids:

* My favorite mathematical object is the ultrafilter.

* My favorite theorem is Barwise's extension theoremâ€”see [this blog post]({{ site.url }}/2018/04/26/barwise.html).

* When I was a child I memorized the first 100 digits of pi, and I'm ashamed that I have yet to forget them.

* Prior to starting grad school I worked as a software engineer.
