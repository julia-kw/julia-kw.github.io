Hi! I am Kameryn Julia Williams (they/she), a logician and mathematician at Bard College at Simon's Rock.

In contexts where first names are appropriate, either of my names are fine to use. When citing me or otherwise talking about me in professional contexts, they/them/their prounouns are preferred.

My research interests specialize in set theory, with much of my work motivated by aspects of the multiversist view of set theory, advocated by Hamkins and others. Outside of pure set theory, I'm interested in its connections to other areas of logic and to philosophy of mathematics. 

Some miscellaneous factoids:

* My favorite mathematical object is the ultrafilter.

* My favorite theorem is Barwise's extension theoremâ€”see [this blog post]({{ site.url }}/2018/04/26/barwise.html).

* When I was a child I memorized the first 100 digits of pi, and I'm ashamed that I have yet to forget them.

* Prior to starting grad school I worked as a software engineer.
